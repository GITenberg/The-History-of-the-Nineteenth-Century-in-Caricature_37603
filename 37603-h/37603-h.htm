<h1><span class="pagenum"><a id="page1" name="page1"></a>(p. 1)</span> HISTORY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN CARICATURE</h1>

<h2>PART I<br>
<i>THE NAPOLEONIC ERA</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">THE BEGINNING OF POLITICAL CARICATURE</span></h3>

<p>While the impulse to satirize public men in picture is probably as old
as satiric verse, if not older, the political cartoon, as an effective
agent in molding public opinion, is essentially a product of modern
conditions and methods. As with the campaign song, its success depends
upon its timeliness, upon the ability to seize upon a critical moment,
a burning question of the hour, and anticipate the outcome while
public excitement is still at a white heat. But unlike satiric verse,
it is dependent upon ink and paper. It cannot be transmitted orally.
The doggerel verses of the Roman legions passed from camp to camp with
the mysterious swiftness of an epidemic, and found their way even into
the sober history of Suetonius. The topical songs and parodies of the
Middle Ages migrated from town to town with the strolling minstrels,
as readily as did the cycles of heroic poetry. But with caricature the
case was very different. It may be that the man of the Stone Age, whom
Mr. Opper has lately utilized so cleverly in a series of caricatures,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>(p. 2)</span> was the first to draw rude and distorted likenesses of some
unpopular chieftain, just as the Roman soldier of 79 <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> scratched
on the wall of his barracks in Pompeii an unflattering portrait of
some martinet centurion which the ashes of Vesuvius have preserved
until to-day. It is certain that the Greeks and Romans appreciated the
power of ridicule latent in satiric pictures; but until the era of the
printing press, the caricaturist was as one crying in a wilderness.
And it is only with the modern co-operation of printing and
photography that caricature has come into its full inheritance. The
best and most telling cartoons are those which do not merely reflect
current public opinion, but guide it. In looking back over a century
of caricature, we are apt to overlook this distinction. A cartoon
which cleverly illustrates some important historical event, and throws
light upon the contemporary attitude of the public, is equally
interesting to-day, whether it anticipated the event or was published
a month afterward. But in order to influence public opinion,
caricature must contain a certain element of prophecy. It must suggest
a danger or point an interrogation. As an example, we may compare two
famous cartoons by the English artist Gillray, "A Connoisseur
Examining a Cooper" and the "King of Brobdingnag and Gulliver." In the
latter, George III., in the guise of a giant, is curiously examining
through his magnifying glass a Lilliputian Napoleon. There is no
element of prophecy about the cartoon. It simply reflects the
contemptuous attitude of the time toward Napoleon, and underestimates
the danger. The other cartoon, which appeared several years earlier,
shows the King anxiously examining the features of Cooper's well-known
miniature of Cromwell, the great overthrower of kings. Public
sentiment at that time suggested the imminence of another
revolution, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>(p. 4)</span> and the cartoon suggests a momentous question:
"Will the fate of Charles I. be repeated?" In the light of history,
the Gulliver cartoon is to-day undoubtedly the more interesting, but
at the time of its appearance it could not have produced anything
approaching the sensation of that of "a Connoisseur."</p>

<p class="smcap">Gillray's Conception of the French Invasion of
England.</p>
</div>

<p>The necessity of getting a caricature swiftly before the public has
always been felt, and has given rise to some curious devices and
makeshifts. In the example which we have noted as having come down
from Roman times, a patriotic citizen of Pompeii could find no better
medium for giving his cartoon of an important local event to the world
than by scratching it upon the wall of his dwelling-house after the
fashion of the modern advertisement. There was a time in the
seventeenth century when packs of political playing-cards enjoyed an
extended vogue. The fashion of printing cartoons upon ladies' fans and
other articles of similarly intimate character was a transitory fad in
England a century ago. Mr. Ackermann, a famous printer of his
generation, and publisher of the greater part of Rowlandson's
cartoons, adopted as an expedient for spreading political news a small
balloon with an attached mechanism, which, when liberated, would drop
news bulletins at intervals as it passed over field and village. In
this country many people of the older generation will still remember
the widespread popularity of the patriotic caricature-envelopes that
were circulated during the Civil War. To-day we are so used to the
daily newspaper cartoon that we do not stop to think how seriously
handicapped the cartoonists of a century ago found themselves. The
more important cartoons of Gillray and Rowlandson appeared either in
monthly periodicals, such as the <i>Westminster Magazine</i> and the
<i>Oxford Magazine</i>, or in separate sheets that sold at the
prohibitive <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>(p. 6)</span> price of several shillings. In times of great
public excitement, as during the later years of the Napoleonic wars,
such cartoons were bought up greedily, the City vying with the
aristocratic West End in their patriotic demand for them. But such
times were exceptional, and the older caricaturists were obliged to
let pass many interesting crises because the situations would have
become already stale before the day of publication of the monthly
magazines came round. With the advent of the illustrated weeklies the
situation was improved, but it is only in recent times that the ideal
condition has been reached, when the cabled news of yesterday is
interpreted in the cartoon of to-day.</p>

<p class="smcap">Nelson at the Battle of the Nile.</p>
</div>

<p>There is another and less specific reason why caricature had to await
the advent of printing and the wider dissemination of knowledge which
resulted. The successful political <span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>(p. 7)</span> cartoon presupposes a
certain average degree of intelligence in a nation, an awakened civic
conscience, a sense of responsibility for the nation's welfare. The
cleverest cartoonist would waste his time appealing to a nation of
feudal vassals; he could not expect to influence a people to whom the
ballot box was closed. Caricature flourishes best in an atmosphere of
democracy; there is an eternal incompatibility between its audacious
irreverence and the doctrine of the divine right of kings.</p>

<p class="smcap">Bonaparte 48 Hours after Landing.</p>
</div>

<p>And yet the best type of caricature should not require a high degree
of intelligence. Many clever cartoonists over-reach themselves by an
excess of cleverness, appealing at best to a limited audience. Of this
type are the cartoons whose point lies in parodying some famous
painting or a masterpiece of literature, which, as a result,
necessarily remains caviare to the general. There is a type of
portrait caricature so cultured and subtle that it often produces
likenesses truer to the man we know in real life than a photograph
would be. A good example of this type is the familiar work of William
Nicholson, whose portrait of the late Queen of England is said to have
been recognized by her as one of the most characteristic pictures she
had ever had taken. What appeals to the public, however, is a coarser
type, a gross exaggeration of prominent features, a willful
distortion, resulting in ridicule or glorification. Oftentimes the
caricature degenerates into a mere symbol. We have outgrown the
puerility of the pictorial pun which flourished in England at the
close of the seventeenth century, when cartoonists of Gillray's rank
were content to represent Lord Bute as a pair of boots, Lord North as
Boreas, the north wind, and the elder Fox with the head and tail of
the animal suggested by his name. Yet personification of one kind
and another, and notably the personification <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>(p. 9)</span> of the nations
in the shape of John Bull and Uncle Sam and the Russian Bear, forms
the very alphabet of political caricature of the present day. Some of
the most memorable series that have ever appeared were founded upon a
chance resemblance of the subject of them to some natural object.
Notable instances are Daumier's famous series of Louis Philippe
represented as a pear, and Nast's equally clever, but more local,
caricatures of Tweed as a money-bag. It would be interesting, if the
material were accessible, to trace the development of the different
personifications of England, France, and Russia, and the rest, from
their first appearance in caricature, but unfortunately their earlier
development cannot be fully traced. The underlying idea of
representing the different nations as individuals, and depicting the
great international crises in a series of allegories or parables or
animal stories&mdash;a sort of pictorial Æsop's fables&mdash;dates back to the
very beginning of caricature. In one of the earliest cartoons that
have been preserved, England, France, and a number of minor
principalities which have since disappeared from the map of Europe,
are represented as playing a game of cards with some disputed island
possessions as the stakes. In this case the several nations are
indicated merely by heraldic emblems. The conception of John Bull was
not to be evolved until a couple of centuries later. This cartoon,
like the others of that time, originated in France under Louis XII.
The further development of the art was decisively checked under the
despotic reign of Louis XIV., and the few caricaturists of that time
who had the courage to use their pencil against the king were driven
to the expedient of publishing their works in Holland.</p>

<p>An impressive illustration of the advantage which the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>(p. 10)</span>
satirical poet has over the cartoonist lies in the fact that some of
the cleverest political satire ever written, as well as the best

produced in France at this very time in the fables of La Fontaine.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>(p. 12)</span> CHAPTER II<br>
<span class="smaller">HOGARTH AND HIS TIMES</span></h3>

<p>From Holland caricature migrated to Great Britain in the closing years
of the seventeenth century&mdash;a natural result of the attention which
Dutch cartoonists had bestowed upon the revolution of 1688&mdash;and there
it found a fertile and congenial soil. The English had not had time to
forget that they had once put the divine right of kings to the test of
the executioner's block, and what little reverence still survived was
not likely to afford protection for a race of imported monarchs.
Moreover, as it happened, the development of English caricature was
destined to be guided by the giant genius of two men, Hogarth and
Gillray; and however far apart these two men were in their moral and
artistic standards, they had one thing in common, a perennial scorn
for the House of Hanover. Hogarth's contemptuous satire of George II.
was more than echoed in Gillray's merciless attacks upon George III.
The well-known cartoons of "Farmer George," and "George the
Button-Maker," were but two of the countless ways in which he avenged
himself upon the dull-witted king who had once acknowledged that he
could not see the point of Gillray's caricatures.</p>

<p>Although Hogarth antedates the period covered by the present articles
by fully half a century, he is much too commanding a figure in the
history of comic art to be summarily dismissed. The year 1720 marks
the era of the so-called "bubble mania," the era of unprecedented
inflation, of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>(p. 13)</span> South Sea Company in London, and the
equally notorious Mississippi schemes of John Law in France. Popular
excitement found vent in a veritable deluge of cartoons, many of which
originated in Amsterdam and were reprinted in London, often with the
addition of explanatory satiric verses in English. In one, Fortune is
represented riding in a car driven by Folly, and drawn by
personifications of the different companies responsible for the
disastrous epidemic of speculation: the Mississippi, limping along on
a wooden leg; the South Sea, with its foot in splints, etc. In
another, we have an imaginary map of the Southern seas, representing
"the very famous island of Madhead, situated in Share Sea, and
inhabited by all kinds of people, to which is given the general name
of Shareholders." John Law came in for a major share of the
caricaturist's attention. In one picture he is represented as
assisting Atlas to bear up immense globes of wind; in another, he is a
"wind-monopolist," declaring, "The wind is my treasure, cushion, and
foundation. Master of the wind, I am master of life, and my wind
monopoly becomes straightway the object of idolatry." The <i>windy</i>
character of the share-business is the dominant note in the cartoons
of the period. Bubbles, windmills, flying kites, play a prominent part
in the detail with which the background of the typical Dutch
caricature was always crowded. These cartoons, displayed conspicuously
in London shop windows, were not only seen by Hogarth, but influenced
him vitally. His earliest known essay in political caricature is an
adaptation of one of these Dutch prints, representing the wheel of
Fortune, bearing the luckless and infatuated speculators high aloft.
His latest work still shows the influence of Holland in the endless
wealth of minute detail, the painstaking elaboration of his
backgrounds, in which the most patient <span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>(p. 15)</span> examination is ever
finding something new. With Hogarth, the overcharged method of the
Dutch school became a medium for irrepressible genius. At the hands of
his followers and imitators, it became a source of obscurity and
confusion.</p>

</div>

<p>While Hogarth is rightly recognized as the father of English
caricature, it must be remembered that his best work was done on the
social rather than on the political side. Even his most famous
political series, that of "The Elections," is broadly generalized. It
is not in any sense campaign literature, but an exposition of
contemporary manners. And this was always Hogarth's aim. He was by
instinct a realist, endowed with a keen sense of humor&mdash;a quality in
which many a modern realist is deficient. He satirized life as he saw
it, the good and the bad together, with a frankness which at times was
somewhat brutal, like the frankness of Fielding and of Smollett the
frankness of the age they lived in. It was essentially an outspoken
age, robust and rather gross; a red-blooded age, nurtured on English
beef and beer; a jovial age that shook its sides over many a broad
jest, and saw no shame in open allusion to the obvious and elemental
facts of physical life. Judged by the standards of his day, there is
little offense in Hogarth's work; even when measured by our own, he is
not deliberately licentious. On the contrary, he set an example of
moderation which his successors would have done well to imitate. He
realized, as the later caricaturists of his century did not, that the
great strength of pictorial satire lies in ridicule rather than in
invective; that the subtlest irony often lies in a close adherence to
truth, where riotous and unrestrained exaggeration defeats its own
end. Just as in the case of "Joseph Andrews," Fielding's creative
instinct got the upper hand of the parodist, so in much of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>(p. 17)</span>
Hogarth's work one feels that the caricaturist is forced to yield
place to the realistic artist, the student of human life, carried away
by the interest of the story he has to tell. His chief gift to
caricature is his unprecedented development of the narrative quality
in pictorial art. He pointed a road along which his imitators could
follow him only at a distance.</p>

Administration."</p>
</div>

<p>With the second half of the eighteenth century there began an era of
great license in the political press, an era of bitter vituperation
and vile personal abuse. Hogarth was one of the chief sufferers. After
holding aloof from partisan politics for nearly half a century, he
published, in 1762, his well-known cartoon attacking the ex-minister,
Pitt. All Europe is represented in flames, which are spreading to
Great Britain in spite of the efforts of Lord Bute, aided by his
Highlanders, to extinguish them. Pitt is blowing upon the flames,
which are being fed by the Duke of Newcastle from a barrow full of
<i>Monitors</i> and <i>North Britons</i>, two scurrilous papers of the day. The
bitterness with which Hogarth was attacked in retaliation and the
persistence of his persecutors resulted, as was generally believed at
the time, in a broken heart and his death in 1764.</p>

<p>An amazing increase in the number of caricatures followed the entry of
Lord Bute's ministry into power. They were distinguished chiefly by
their poor execution and gross indecency. As early as 1762, the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, itself none too immaculate, complains that
"Many of the representations that have lately appeared in the shops
are not only reproachful to the government, but offensive to
common-sense; they discover a tendency to inflame, without a spark of
fire to light their own combustion." The state of society in England
was at this time notoriously immoral and licentious. It was a period
of hard living and hard drinking. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>(p. 18)</span> The well-known habits of
such public figures as Sheridan and Fox are eminent examples. The
spirit of gambling had become a mania, and women had caught the
contagion as well as men. Nowhere was the profligacy of the times more
clearly shown than in the looseness of public social functions, such
as the notorious masquerade balls, which a contemporary journal, the
<i>Westminster Magazine</i>, seriously decried as "subversive of virtue and
every noble and domestic point of honor." The low standards of morals
and want of delicacy are revealed in the extravagance of women's
dress, the looseness of their speech. It was an age when women of
rank, such as Lady Buckingham and Lady Archer, were publicly
threatened by an eminent judge with exposure on the pillory for having
systematically enticed young men and robbed them at their faro tables,
and afterward found themselves exposed in the pillory of popular
opinion in scurrilous cartoons from shop windows all over London.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>(p. 20)</span> CHAPTER III<br>
<span class="smaller">JAMES GILLRAY</span></h3>

<p>At a time when cheap abuse took the place of technical skill, and
vulgarity passed for wit, a man of unlimited audacity, who was also a
consummate master of his pencil, easily took precedence. Such a man
was James Gillray, unquestionably the leading cartoonist of the reign
of George III. Yet of the many who are to-day familiar with the name
of Gillray and the important part he played in influencing public
opinion during the struggle with Napoleon, very few have an
understanding of the dominant qualities of his work. A large part of
it, and probably the most representative part, is characterized by a
foulness and an obscenity which the present generation cannot
countenance. There is a whole series of cartoons bearing his name
which it would not only be absolutely out of the question to
reproduce, but the very nature of which can be indicated only in the
most guarded manner. Imagine the works of Rabelais shamelessly
illustrated by a master hand! Try to conceive of the nature of the
pictures which Panurge chalked up on the walls of old Paris. It was
not merely the fault of the times, as in the case of Hogarth. Public
taste was sufficiently depraved already; but Gillray deliberately
prostituted his genius to the level of a procurer, to debauch it
further. From first to last his drawings impress one as emanating from
a mind not only unclean, but unbalanced as well&mdash;a mind over which
there hung, even at the beginning, the furtive shadow of that
madness which at last overtook <span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name="page22"></a>(p. 22)</span> and blighted him. There is but
one of the hallmarks of great caricature in the work of Gillray, and
that is the lasting impression which they make. They refuse to be
forgotten; they remain imprinted on the brain, like the obsession of a
nightmare. While in one sense they stand as a pitiless indictment of
the generation that tolerated them, they are not a reflection of the
life that Gillray saw, except in the sense that their physical
deformity symbolizes the moral foulness of the age. Grace and charm
and physical beauty, which Hogarth could use effectively, are unknown
quantities to Gillray. There is an element of monstrosity about all
his figures, distorted and repellent. Foul, bloated faces; twisted,
swollen limbs; unshapely figures whose protuberant flesh suggests a
tumefied and fungoid growth&mdash;such is the brood begotten by Gillray's
pencil, like the malignant spawn of some forgotten circle of the lower
inferno.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be idle to dispute the far-reaching power of Gillray's
genius, perverted though it was. Throughout the Napoleonic wars,
caricature and the name of Gillray are convertible terms; for, even
after he was forced to lay down his pencil, his brilliant
contemporaries and successors, Rowlandson and Cruikshank, found
themselves unable to throw off the fetters of his influence. No
history of Napoleon is quite complete which fails to recognize Gillray
as a potent factor in crystallizing public opinion in England. His
long series of cartoons aimed at "little Boney" are the culminating
work of his life. Their power lay, not in intellectual subtlety or
brilliant scintillation of wit, but in the bitterness of their
invective, the appeal they make to elemental passions. They spoke a
language which the roughest of London mobs could understand&mdash;the
language of the gutter. They were, many of them, masterpieces of
pictorial Billingsgate.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>(p. 24)</span> There is rancor, there is venom, there is the inevitable
inheritance of the warfare of centuries, in these caricatures of
Gillray, but above all there is fear&mdash;fear of Napoleon, of his genius,
of his star. It has been very easy for Englishmen of later days to say
that the French never could have crossed the Channel, that there was
never any reason for disquiet; it was another matter in the days when
troops were actually massing by thousands on the hills behind
Boulogne. You can find this fear voiced everywhere in Gillray, in the
discordance between the drawings and the text. John Bull is the ox,
Bonaparte the contemptible frog; but it is usually the ox who is
bellowing out defiance, daring the other to "come on," flinging down
insult at the diminutive foe. "Let 'em come, damme!" shouts the bold
Briton in the pictures of the time. "Damme! where are the French
bugaboos? Single-handed I'll beat forty of 'em, damme!" Every means
was used to rouse the spirit of the English nation, and to stimulate
hatred of the French and their leader. In one picture, Boney and his
family are in rags, and are gnawing raw bones in a rude Corsican hut;
in another we find him with a hookah and turban, having adopted the
Mahometan religion; in a third we see him murdering the sick at Joppa.
In the caricatures of Gillray, Napoleon is always a monster, a fiend
in human shape, craven and murderous; but when dealing with the
question of this fiend's power for evil, Gillray made no attempt at
consistency. This ogre, who through one series of pictures was
represented as kicked about from boot to boot, kicked by the
Spaniards, the Turks, the Austrians, the Prussians, the Russians, in
another is depicted as being very dangerous indeed. A curious example
of this inconsistency will be found in placing side by side the two
cartoons considered by many to be Gillray's best: "The King of
Brobdingnag <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>(p. 26)</span> and Gulliver," already referred to, and
"Tiddy-Doll, the great French gingerbread Maker, Drawing out a new
Batch of Kings." The "pernicious, little, odious reptile" whom George
the Third is holding so contemptuously in the hollow of his hand, in
the first caricature, is in the second concededly of European
importance.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>(p. 28)</span> CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="smaller">BONAPARTE AS FIRST CONSUL</span></h3>

<p>For the first decade of the nineteenth century there was but one
important source of caricature, and one all-important subject&mdash;England
and Bonaparte. America at this time counted for little in
international politics. The revolutionary period closed definitely
with the death of Washington, the one figure in our national politics
who stood for something definite in the eyes of Europe. Our incipient
naval war with France, which for a moment threatened to assign us a
part in the general struggle of the Powers, was amicably concluded
before the close of the eighteenth century. Throughout the
Jeffersonian period, national and local satire and burlesque
flourished, atoning in quantity for what it lacked in wit and artistic
skill. Mr. Parton, in his "Caricature and Other Comic Art," finds but
one cartoon which he thinks it worth while to cite&mdash;Jefferson kneeling
before a pillar labeled "Altar of Gallic Despotism," upon which are
Paine's "Age of Reason," and the works of Rousseau, Voltaire, and
Helvetius, with the demon of the French Revolution crouching behind
it, and the American Eagle soaring to the sky bearing away the
Constitution and the independence of the United States, and he adds:
"Pictures of that nature, of great size, crowded with objects,
emblems, and sentences&mdash;an elaborate blending of burlesque, allegory,
and enigma&mdash;were so much valued by that generation that some of them
were engraved upon copper."</p>

</div>

<p>France, on the contrary, the central stage of the great <span class="pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>(p. 29)</span>
drama of nations, might at this time have produced a school of
caricaturists worthy of their opportunity&mdash;a school that would have
offset with its Gallic wit the heavier school of British invective,
and might have furnished Napoleon with a strong weapon against his
most persistent enemies, had he not, with questionable wisdom, sternly
repressed pictorial satire of a political nature. As the century
opens, the drama of the ensuing fourteen years becomes clearly
defined; the prologue has been played; Napoleon's ambition in the East
has been checked, first by the Battle of the Nile, and then definitely
at Aboukir. Henceforth he is to limit his schemes of conquest to
Europe, and John Bull is the only national figure who seems likely to
attempt to check him. The Battle of the Nile was commemorated by
Gillray, who depicted <span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name="page30"></a>(p. 30)</span> Nelson's victory in a cartoon entitled
"Extirpation of the Plagues of Egypt, Destruction of the Revolutionary
Crocodiles, or the British Hero Cleansing the Mouth of the Nile." Here
Nelson is shown dispersing the French fleet treated as crocodiles. He
has destroyed numbers with his cudgel of British oak; he is beating
down others; a whole bevy, with hooks through their noses, are
attached by strings to the iron hook which replaced his lost forearm.
In the distance a crocodile is bursting and casting fire and ruin on
all sides. This is an allusion to the destruction of the <i>Orient</i>, the
flagship of the Republican Admiral, the heroic Brueys, who declined to
quit his post when literally cut to pieces.</p>

<p>Another cartoon by Gillray which belongs to this period is "The French
Consular Triumvirate Settling the New Constitution." It introduces the
figures of Napoleon and his fellow-consuls, Cambacérès and Lebrun, who
replaced the very authors of the new instrument, Sièyes and Ducos,
quietly deposed by Napoleon within the year. The second and third
consuls are provided with blank sheets of paper, for mere form&mdash;they
have only to bite their pens. The Corsican is compiling a constitution
in accordance with his own views. A band of imps is beneath the table,
forging new chains for France and for Europe.</p>

<p>In England, the Addington ministry, which in 1801 replaced that of
William Pitt, and are represented in caricature as "Lilliputian
substitutes" lost in the depths of Mr. Pitt's jack-boots, set out as a
peace ministry and entered into the negotiations with Napoleon which,
in the following March, resulted in the Peace of Amiens. Gillray
anticipated this peace with several alarmist cartoons: "Preliminaries
of Peace," representing John Bull being led by the nose across the
channel over a rotten plank, while Britannia's shield and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page31" name="page31"></a>(p. 31)</span>
several valuable possessions have been cast aside into the water; and
"Britannia's Death Warrant," in which Britannia is seen being dragged
away to the guillotine by the Corsican marauder. The peace at first
gave genuine satisfaction in England, but toward the end of 1802 there
were growing signs of popular discontent, which Gillray voiced in "The
Nursery, with Britannia Reposing in Peace." Britannia is here
portrayed as an overgrown baby in her cradle and fed upon French
principles by Addington, Lord Hawkesbury, and Fox. Still more famous
was his next cartoon, "The First Kiss this Ten Years; or, the Meeting
of Britannia and Citizen Francois." Britannia, grown enormously stout,
her shield and spear idly reposing against the wall, is blushing
deeply at his warm embrace and ardent expressions of joy: "Madame,
permit me to pay my profound esteem to your engaging person, and to
seal on your divine lips my everlasting attachment!!!" She replies:
"Monsieur, you are truly a well-bred gentleman; and though you make
me blush, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>(p. 32)</span> yet you kiss so delicately that I cannot refuse
you, though I was sure you would deceive me again." In the background
the portraits of King George and Bonaparte scowl fiercely at each
other upon the wall. This is said to be one of the very few
caricatures which Napoleon himself heartily enjoyed.</p>

<p>From now on, the cartoons take on a more caustic tone. Britannia is
being robbed of her cherished possessions, even Malta being on the
point of being wrested from her; while the bugaboo of an invading army
looms large upon the horizon. In one picture Britannia, unexpectedly
attacked by Napoleon's fleet, is awakening from a trance of fancied
peace, and praying that her "angels and ministers of <i>dis</i>grace defend
her!" In another, John Bull, having waded across the water, is
taunting little Boney, whose head just shows above the wall of his
fortress:</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you mean to invade us, why make such a rout?<br>
  I say, little Boney, why don't you come out?<br>
<span class="add1em">Yes, d&mdash;&mdash; you, why don't you come out?</span></p>

<p>In his cartoon called "Promised Horrors of the French Invasion; or,
Forcible Reasons for Negotiating a Regicide Peace," Gillray painted
the imaginary landing of the French in England. The ferocious legions
are pouring from St. James's Palace, which is in flames, and they are
marching past the clubs. The practice of patronizing democracy in the
countries they had conquered has been carried out by handing over the
Tories, the constitution, and the crown to the Foxite reformers and
the Whig party. The chief hostility of the French troops is directed
against the aristocratic clubs. An indiscriminate massacre of the
members of White's is proceeding in the doorways, on the balconies,
and wherever the republican levies have penetrated. The royal princes
are stabbed and thrown into the street. A rivulet of blood is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>(p. 34)</span> running. In the center of the picture is a tree of liberty.
To this tree Pitt is bound, while Fox is lashing him.</p>

<p>The increasing venom of the English cartoons, and their frequent
coarse personalities, caused no little uneasiness to Bonaparte, until
they culminated in a famous cartoon by Gillray, "The Handwriting on
the Wall," a broad satire on Belshazzar's feast, which was published
August 24, 1803. The First Consul, his wife Josephine, and the members
of the court are seated at table, consuming the good things of Old
England. The palace of St. James, transfixed upon Napoleon's fork; the
tower of London, which one of the convives is swallowing whole; the
head of King George on a platter inscribed: "Oh, de beef of Old

<p>For the next year parliamentary strife at home, fostered by Pitt's
quarrel with the Addington ministry on the one hand and his opposition
to Fox on the other, kept the cartoonists busy. They found time,
however, to celebrate the coronation of Napoleon as Emperor in
December, 1804. Gillray anticipated the event with a cartoon entitled
"The Genius of France Nursing her Darling," in which the genius,
depicted as a lady with blood-stained garments and a reeking spear,
tosses an infant Napoleon, armed with a scepter, and vainly tries to
check his cries with a rattle surmounted by a crown.</p>

<p>Rowlandson, Gillray's clever and more artistic contemporary,
commemorated the event itself in a clever cartoon, "The Death of
Madame République," published December 14, 1804. The moribund
République lies stretched upon her death-bed, her nightcap adorned
with the tricolored cockade. The Abbé Sièyes, in the rôle of doctor,
is exhibiting the Emperor, portrayed as a newborn infant in long
clothes. John Bull, spectacles on nose, is regarding the altered
conditions with visible astonishment. "Pray, Mr. Abbé Sièyes, what was
the cause of the poor lady's death? She seemed at one time in a
tolerable thriving way." "She died in childbed, Mr. Bull, after giving
birth to this little Emperor!"</p>

</div>

<p>This was followed on the 1st of January by a large satirical print by
Gillray, of "The Grand Coronation Procession," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>(p. 36)</span> in which the
feature that gave special offense was the group of three princesses,
the Princess Borghese, the Princess Louise, and the Princess Joseph
Bonaparte, arrayed in garments of indecent scantiness, and heading the
procession as the "three imperial Graces." The English caricatures of
this period relating to the new Emperor and Empress are as a rule not
only libelous, but grossly coarse. At the same time, the political
conditions of the times are cleverly hit off in "The Plum Pudding in
Danger; or, State Epicures Taking on Petit Souper," published February
26, 1805, which depicts the rival pretensions of Napoleon and Pitt.
They are seated at opposite sides of the table, the only dish between
them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>(p. 37)</span> being the Globe, served up on a shallow plate and
resembling a plum pudding. Napoleon's sword has sliced off the
continent&mdash;France, Holland, Spain, Italy, Prussia&mdash;and his fork is dug
spitefully into Hanover, which was then an appanage of the British
crown. Pitt's trident is stuck in the ocean, and his carver is
modestly dividing the Globe down the middle.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1805 the third coalition against France was
completed, its chief factors being Great Britain, Russia, and Austria.
A contemporary print entitled "Tom Thumb at Bay" commemorates the new
armament. Napoleon, dropping crown and scepter in his flight, is
evading the Austrian eagle, the Russian bear, and the Westphalian pig,
only to run at last pell-mell into the gaping jaws of the British
lion. It is somewhat curious that the momentous events of the new
war&mdash;the annihilation of the French fleet at Trafalgar, the equally
decisive French victory at Austerlitz&mdash;were scarcely noticed in
caricature, and a few exceptions have little merit. But in the
following January, 1806, when Napoleon had entered upon an epoch of
king-making, with his kings of Wurtemburg and Bavaria, Gillray
produced one of his most famous prints. It was published the 23d of
January (the day that Pitt breathed his last), and was entitled
"Tiddy-Doll, the Great French Gingerbread Baker, Drawing out a new
Batch of Kings, His Man, 'Hopping Talley,' Mixing up the Dough." The
great gilt gingerbread baker is shown at work at his new French oven
for imperial gingerbread. He is just drawing from the oven's mouth a
fresh batch of kings. The fuel is shown in the form of cannon-balls.
Holland, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Venice and Spain are following
the fate of the French Republic. On top of the chest of drawers,
labeled respectively "kings and queens," "crowns and scepters," "suns
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>(p. 38)</span> moons" is arranged a gay parcel of little dough viceroys
intended for the next batch. Among them are the figures of Fox,
Sheridan, Derby, and others of the Whig party in England.</p>

<p>In the comprehensive and ill-assorted Coalition ministry which was
formed soon after Pitt's death, the caricaturists found a congenial
topic for their pencils. They ridiculed it unmercifully under the
title "All the Talents," and the "Board Bottomed" ministry. A
composite picture by Rowlandson shows the ministry as a spectacled ape
in the wig of a learned justice, with episcopal mitre and Catholic
crozier. He wears a lawyer's coat and ragged breeches, with a shoe on
one foot and a French jack-boot on the other. He is dancing on a
funeral pyre of papers, the results of the administration, its endless
negotiations with France, its sinecures and patronages, which are
blazing away. The creature's foot is discharging a gun, which
produces signal mischief in the rear <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>(p. 39)</span> and brings down two
heavy folios, the Magna Charta and the Coronation Oath, upon its head.</p>

</div>

<p>This ministry's futile negotiations for peace with France are
frequently burlesqued. Gillray published on April 5 "Pacific
Overtures; or, a Flight from St. Cloud's 'over the water to Charley,'"
in which the negotiations are described as "a new dramatic <i>peace</i>,
now rehearsing." In this cartoon King George has left the state
box&mdash;where the play-book of "I Know You All" still remains open&mdash;to
approach nearer to little Boney, who, elevated on the clouds, is
directing attention to his proposed treaty. "Terms of Peace:
Acknowledge me as Emperor; dismantle your fleet, reduce your armies;
abandon Malta and Gibraltar; renounce all continental connection; your
colonies I will take at a valuation; engage to pay to the Great Nation
for seven years annually one million pounds; and place in my hands as
hostages the Princess Charlotte of Wales, with others of the late
administration <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>(p. 40)</span> whom I shall name." King George replies: "Very
amusing terms, indeed, and might do vastly well with some of the
new-made little gingerbread kings; but we are not in the habit of
giving up either ships or commerce or colonies merely because little
Boney is in a pet to have them." This cartoon introduces among others
Talleyrand, O'Conor, Fox, Lord Ellenborough, the Duke of Bedford, Lord
Moira, Lord Lauderdale, Addington, Lord Henry Petty, Lord Derby, and
Mrs. Fitzherbert.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, on July 21, 1806, Rowlandson voices the current
feeling of distrust of Fox in "Experiments at Dover; or, Master
Charley's Magic Lantern." Fox is depicted at Dover, training the rays
of his magic lantern on the cliffs of Calais. John Bull, watching him,
is not satisfied. "Yes, yes, it be all very fine, if it be true; but I
can't forget that d&mdash;d Omnium last week.... I will tell thee what,
Charley, since thee hast become a great man, I think in my heart thee
beest always conjuring."</p>

<p>The cartoon entitled "Westminster Conscripts under the Training Act"
appeared September 1, 1806. Napoleon, the drill sergeant, is elevated
on a pile of cannon-balls; he is giving his authoritative order to
"Ground arms." The invalided Fox has been wheeled to the ground in his
armchair; the Prince of Wales' plume appears on the back of his seat.
Other figures in the cartoon are Lord Lauderdale, Lord Grenville, Lord
Howick, Lord Holland, Lord Robert Spencer, Lord Ellenborough, the Duke
of Clarence, Lord Moira, Lord Chancellor Erskine, Colonel Hanger, and
Talleyrand.</p>

<p>Gillray has left a cartoon commemorating the arrival of the Danish
squadron, under the title of "British Tars Towing the Danish Fleet
into Harbor; the Broad Bottom <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>(p. 43)</span> Leviathan trying to swamp
Billy's Old Boat; and the Little Corsican Tottering on the Clouds of
Ambition." This cartoon was issued October 1, 1807. Lords Liverpool
and Castlereagh are lustily rowing the <i>Billy Pitt</i>; Canning, seated
in the stern, is towing the captured fleet into Sheerness, with the
Union Jack flying over the forts. Copenhagen, smoking from the recent
bombardment, may be distinguished in the distance. In Sheerness harbor
the sign of "Good Old George" is hung out at John Bull's Tavern; John
Bull is seated at the door, a pot of porter in his hand, waving his
hat and shouting: "Rule Britannia! Britannia Rules the Waves!" That
the expedition did not escape censure is shown by the figure of a
three-headed porpoise which is savagely assailing the successful crew.
This monster bears the heads of Lord Howick, shouting "Detraction!"
Lord St. Vincent tilled with "Envy," and discharging a watery
broadside; and Lord Grenville, who is raising his "Opposition Clamor"
to confuse their course.</p>

<p>No period of the Napoleonic wars gave better opportunity for satire
than Napoleon's disastrous occupation of Spain and his invasion of
Portugal. The titles alone of the cartoons would fill a volume. The
sanguine hopes of success cherished by the English government are
expressed by Gillray in a print published April 10, 1808. "Delicious
Dreams! Castles in the Air! Glorious Prospects!" It depicts the
ministers sunken in a drunken sleep and visited by glorious visions of
Britannia and her lion occupying a triumphal car formed from the hull
of a British ship, drawn by an Irish bull and led by an English tar.
She is dragging captive to the Tower little Boney and the Russian
Bear, both loaded with chains.</p>

</div>

<p>The dangers which threatened Napoleon at this period were shown by
Gillray in one of the most striking of all his cartoons, the "Valley
of the Shadow of Death," which was issued September 24, 1808. The
valley is the valley of Bunyan's allegory. The Emperor is proceeding
timorously down a treacherous path, bounded on either side by the
waters of Styx and hemmed in by a circle of flame. From every side
horrors are springing up to assail him. The British lion, raging and
furious, is springing at his throat. The Portuguese wolf has broken
his chain. King Death, mounted on a mule of "True Royal Spanish
Breed," has cleared at a bound the body of the ex-King Joseph, which
has been thrown into the "Ditch of Styx." Death is poising his spear
with fatal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>(p. 46)</span> aim, warningly holding up at the same time his
hour-glass with the sand exhausted; flames follow in his course. From
the smoke rise the figures of Junot and Dupont, the beaten generals.
The papal tiara is descending as a "Roman meteor," charged with
lightnings to blast the Corsican. The "Turkish New Moon" is seen
rising in blood. The "Spirit of Charles XII." rises from the flames to
avenge the wrongs of Sweden. The "Imperial German Eagle" is emerging
from a cloud; the Prussian bird appears as a scarecrow, making
desperate efforts to fly and screaming revenge. From the "Lethean
Ditch" the "American Rattlesnake" is thrusting forth a poisoned
tongue. The "Dutch Frogs" are spitting out their spite; and the
Rhenish Confederation is personified as a herd of starved "Rats,"
ready to feast on the Corsican. The great "Russian Bear," the only
ally Napoleon has secured, is shaking his chain and growling&mdash;a
formidable enemy in the rear.</p>

<p>Gillray's caricature entitled "John Bull Taking a Luncheon; or,
British Cooks Cramming Old Grumble-Gizzard with Bonne Chère," shows
the strange-appearing John of the caricature of that day sitting at a
table, overwhelmed by the zealous attentions of his cooks, foremost
among whom is the hero of the Nile, who is offering him a "Fricassée à
la Nelson," a large dish of battered French ships of the line. John is
swallowing a frigate at a mouthful. Through the window we see Fox and
Sheridan, representative of the Broad Bottom administration, running
away in dismay at John Bull's voracity.</p>

<p>As Gillray retires from the field several other clever artists stand
ready to take his place, and chief among them Rowlandson. The latter
had a distinct advantage over Gillray in his superior artistic
training. He was educated in the French <span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>(p. 48)</span> schools, where he
gave especial attention to studies from the nude. In the opinion of
such capable judges as Reynolds, West, and Lawrence, his gifts might
have won him a high place among English artists, if he had not turned,
through sheer perversity, to satire and burlesque. Rowlandson's
Napoleonic cartoons began in July, 1808. These initial efforts are
neither especially characteristic nor especially clever, but they
certainly were duly appreciated by the public. Joseph Grego, in his
interesting and comprehensive work upon Rowlandson, says of them:</p>

<p>"It is certain that the caricaturist's travesties of the little
Emperor, his burlesques of his great actions and grandiose
declarations, his figurative displays of the mean origin of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>(p. 49)</span> imperial family, with the cowardice and depravity of its
members, won popular applause ... And when disasters began to cloud
the career of Napoleon, as army after army melted away, ... the artist
bent his skill to interpret the delight of the public. The City
competed with the West End in buying every caricature, in loyal
contest to prove their national enmity for Bonaparte. In too many
cases, the incentive was to gratify the hatred of the Corsican rather
than any remarkable merit that could be discovered in the caricatures.
Very few of these mock-heroic sallies imprint themselves upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>(p. 50)</span> the recollection by sheer force of their own brilliancy, as
was the case with Gillray, and frequently with John Tenniel.

<p>On July 8 Rowlandson began his series with "The Corsican Tiger at
Bay." Napoleon is depicted as a savage tiger, rending four "Royal
Greyhounds," quite at his mercy. But a fresh pack appears in the
background and prepares for a fierce charge. The Russian bear and
Austrian eagle are securely bound with heavy fetters, but the eagle is
asking: "Now, Brother Bruin, is it time to break our fetters?"</p>

<p>"The Beast as Described in the Revelations" followed within two weeks.
The beast, of Corsican origin, is represented with seven heads, and
the names of Austria, Naples, Holland, Denmark, Prussia, and Russia
are inscribed on their respective crowns. Napoleon's head, severed
from the trunk, vomits forth flames. In the distance, cities are
blazing, showing the destruction wrought by the beast. Spain is
represented as the champion who alone dares to stand against the
monster.</p>

<p>"The Political Butcher" bears date September 12 of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>(p. 51)</span> the same
year. In this print the Spanish Don, in the garb of a butcher, is
cutting up Bonaparte for the benefit of his neighbors. The body of the
late Corsican lies before him and is being cut up with professional
zeal. The Don holds up his enemy's heart and calls upon the other
Powers to take their share. The double-headed eagle of Austria is
swooping upon Napoleon's head: "I have long wished to strike my talons
into that diabolical head-piece"; the British bulldog has been
enjoying portions of the joints, and thinks that he would "like to
have the picking of that head." The Russian bear is luxuriously
licking Napoleon's boots, and remarks, "This licking is giving me a
mortal inclination to pick a bone."</p>

<p>The final failure of the Spanish campaign is signalized, September 20,
in a cartoon labeled "Napoleon the Little in a Rage with his Great
French Eagle." The Emperor, with drawn sword and bristling with rage,
threatens the French imperial eagle, larger than himself. The bird's
head and one leg are tied up&mdash;the result of damage inflicted by the
Spaniards. "Confusion and destruction!" thunders Napoleon, "what is
this I see? Did I not command you not to return until you had spread
your wing of victory over the whole of Spain?" "Aye, it's fine
talking," rejoins the bird, "but if you had been there, you would not
much have liked it. The Spanish cormorants pursued me in such a manner
that they set me molting in a terrible way. I wonder that I have not
lost my feathers. Besides, it got so hot I could not bear it any
longer."</p>

<p>In August, 1809, Rowlandson published "The Rising Sun." Bonaparte is
surrounded by the Continental powers, and is busy rocking to sleep in
a cradle the Russian bear, securely muzzled with French promises.
But the dawn of a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>(p. 53)</span> new era is breaking: the sun of Spain and
Portugal is rising with threatening import. The Emperor is disturbed
by the new light: "This rising sun has set me upon thorns." The
Prussian eagle is trussed; Denmark is snuffed out. But Austria has
once more taken heart: "Tyrant, I defy thee and thy cursed crew!"</p>

<p>The victories of the Peninsular war, and later of the disastrous
Russian campaign, called forth an ever-increasing number of cartoons,
which showed little mercy or consideration to a fallen foe. A sample
of the titles of this period show the general tendency; he is the
"Corsican Bloodhound," the "Carcass-Butcher"; he is a jail-bird doing
the "Rogues' March to the Island of Elba." An analysis of a few of the
more striking cartoons will serve to close the survey of the
Napoleonic period. "Death and Bonaparte" is a grewsome cartoon by
Rowlandson, dated January 1, 1814. Napoleon is seated on a drum with
his head clasped between his hands, staring into the face of a
skeleton Death, who is watching the baffled general, face to face.
Death mockingly parodies Napoleon's attitude. A broken eagle, the
imperial standard, lies at his bony feet. In the background the
Russian, Prussian, Austrian, and other allied armies are streaming
past in unbroken ranks, routing the dismayed legions of France.</p>

<p>"Bloody Boney, the Corsican Butcher, Left off Trade and Retiring to
Scarecrow Island" is the title of still another of Rowlandson's
characteristic cartoons. In it Napoleon is represented as riding on a
rough-coated donkey and wearing a fool's cap in place of a crown. His
only provision is a bag of brown bread. His consort is riding on the
same beast, which is being unmercifully flogged with a stick labeled
"Bâton Maréchal."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>(p. 55)</span> Napoleon's escape from Elba was commemorated by Rowlandson in
"The Flight of Bonaparte from Hell Bay." In it the foul fiend is
amusing himself by letting his captive loose, to work fresh mischief
in the world above. He has mounted the Corsican upon a bubble and
sends him careering upward back to earth, while hissing dragons pour
forth furious blasts to waft the bubble onward.</p>

<p>"Hell Hounds Rallying around the Idol of France" is the title of
still another of Rowlandson's designs, which appeared in April, 1815.
The head and bust of the Emperor drawn on a colossal scale, a
hangman's noose around his throat, is mounted on a vast pyramid of
human heads, his decapitated victims. Demons are flying through the
air to place upon his brow a crown of blazing pitch, while a ring of
other excited fiends, whose features represent Maréchal Ney, Lefebre,
Davoust <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>(p. 56)</span> and others, with horns, hoofs, and tails, are dancing
in triumph around the idol they have replaced. Closely resembling this
cartoon of Rowlandson is the German cartoon, which is reproduced in
these pages, showing a double-faced Napoleon topping a monument built
of skulls. Rowlandson's "Hell Hounds Rallying around the Idol of
France" was the last English cartoon directed against Napoleon when he
was at the head of France. Two months later the Emperor's power was
finally broken at Waterloo.</p>

<p>With the downfall of Napoleon the Gillray school of caricature came to
an abrupt and very natural close. It was a school born of fear and
nurtured upon rancor&mdash;a school that indulged freely in obscenity and
sacrilege, and did not hesitate to stoop to kick the fallen hero, to
heap insult and ignominy upon Napoleon in his exile. Only during a
great world crisis, a death struggle of nations, could popular opinion
have tolerated such wanton disregard for decency. And when the crisis
was passed it came to an end like some malignant growth, strangled by
its own virulence. The truth is that Gillray and Rowlandson led
caricature into an <i>impasse</i>; they deliberately perverted its true
function, which is, to advance an argument with the cogent force of a
clever orator, to sum up a political issue in terms so simple that a
child may read, and not merely to echo back the blatant rancor of the
mob. In the hands of a master of the art it becomes an incisive
weapon, like the blade with which the matador gives his
<i>coup-de-grace</i>. Gillray's conception of its office seems to have been
that of the red rag to be flapped tauntingly in the face of John
Bull; and John Bull obediently bellowed in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page59" name="page59"></a>(p. 59)</span> response. It would
be idle to deny that for the purpose of spurring on public opinion,
the Napoleonic cartoons exercised a potent influence. They kept
popular excitement at fever heat; they added fuel to the general
hatred. But when the crisis was passed, when the public pulse was
beating normally once more, when virulent attacks upon a helpless
exile had ceased to seem amusing, there really remained no material
upon which caricature of the Gillray type could exercise its offensive
ingenuity. What seemed justifiable license when directed against the
arch-enemy of European peace would have been insufferable when applied
to British statesmen and to the milder problems of local political
issues. Another and quite practical reason helps to explain the dearth
of political caricature in England for a full generation after the
battle of Waterloo, and that is the question of expense. A public
which freely gave shillings and even pounds to see its hatred of
"Little Boney" interpreted with Gillray's vindictive malice hesitated
to expend even pennies for a cartoon on the corn laws or the latest
ministerial changes. In England, as well as on the Continent,
caricature as an effective factor in politics remained in abeyance
until the advent of an essentially modern type of periodical, the
comic weekly, of which <i>La Caricature</i>, the London <i>Punch</i>, the
<i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, and in this country <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i>, are the
most famous examples. The progress of lithography made such a
periodical possible in France as early as 1830, when <i>La Caricature</i>
was founded by the famous Philipon; but the oppressive laws of
censorship throughout Europe prevented any wide development of this
class of journalism until after the general political upheaval of
1848.</p>

<p>It would be idle, however, to deny that Gillray exerted a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name="page61"></a>(p. 61)</span>
lasting influence upon all future caricature. His license, his
vulgarity, his repulsive perversion of the human face and form, have
found no disciples in later generations; but his effective assemblage
of many figures, the crowded significance of minor details, the
dramatic unity of the whole conception which he inherited from
Hogarth, have been passed on down the line and still continue to
influence the leading cartoonists of to-day in England, Germany, and
the United States, although to a much less degree in France. Even at
the time of Napoleon's downfall the few cartoons which appeared in
Paris were far less extreme than their English models, while the
German caricaturists, on the contrary, were extremely virulent,
notably the Berliner, Schadow, who openly acknowledged his
indebtedness to the Englishman by signing himself the Parisian
Gillray; and Volz, author of the famous "true portrait of Napoleon"&mdash;a
portrait in which Napoleon's face, upon closer inspection, is seen
made up of a head of inextricably tangled dead bodies, his head
surmounted by a bird of prey, his breast a map of Europe overspread by
a vast spider web, in which the different national capitals are
entangled like so many luckless flies. Had there been more liberty of
the press, an interesting school of political cartoonists might have
arisen at this time in Germany. But they met with such scanty
encouragement that little of real interest is to be gleaned from this
source until after the advent of the Berlin <i>Kladderadatsch</i> in 1848,
and the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, but a short time earlier.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE "POIRE"</span></h3>

<p>Throughout the Napoleonic period England practically had a monopoly in
caricature. During the second period, down to the year 1848, France is
the center of interest. Prior to 1830, French political cartoons were
neither numerous nor especially significant. Indeed they present a
simplicity of imagination rather amusing as compared with the
complicated English caricatures. A hate of the Jesuits, a mingling of
liberalism, touched with Bonapartism, and the war of newspapers
furnished the theme. The two symbols constantly recurring are the
<i>girouette</i>, or weather-cock, and the <i>éteignoir</i>, or extinguisher.
Many of the French statesmen who played a prominent part during the
French Empire and after the Restoration changed their political creed
with such surprising rapidity that it was difficult to keep track of
their changes. They were accordingly symbolized by a number of
weathercocks proportioned to the number of their political
conversions, Talleyrand leading the procession, with not less than
seven to his credit. The <i>éteignoir</i> was constantly used in satire
directed against the priesthood, the most famous instance appearing in
the <i>Minerva</i> in 1819. It took for the text a refrain from a song of
Beranger. In this cartoon the Church is personified by the figure of
the Pope holding in one hand a sabre, and, in the other, a paper with
the words Bulls, crusades, Sicilian vespers, St. Bartholomew. Beside
the figure of the Church, torch in hand, is the demon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>(p. 66)</span> of
discord. From the smoke of the torch of the demon various horrors are
escaping. We read "the restoration of feudal rights," "feudal
privileges," "division of families." Monks are trying to snuff out the
memory of Fénelon, Buffon, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montaigne, and other
philosophers and thinkers. For ten years the caricaturists played with
this theme. A feeble forerunner of <i>La Caricature</i>, entitled <i>Le Nain
Jaune</i>, depended largely for its wit upon the variations it could
improvise upon the <i>girouette</i> and upon the <i>éteignoir</i>.</p>

<p>Yet it would be a mistake to suppose that French art was quite
destitute of humorists at the beginning of the century. M. Armand
Dayot, in a monograph upon French caricature, mentions among others
the names of Isabey, Boilly, and Carle Vernet as rivaling the English
cartoonists in the ingenuity of their designs, and surpassing them in
artistic finish and harmony of color. "But," he adds, "they were never
able to go below the surface in their satire. It would be a mistake to
enroll in the hirsute cohort of caricaturists these witty and charming
artists, who were more concerned in depicting the pleasures of mundane
life than in castigating its vices and irregularities." The 4th of
November, 1830, is a momentous date in the history of French
caricature. Prior to that time, French cartoons, such as there were,
were studiously, even painfully, impersonal. Thackeray, in his
delightful essay upon "Caricatures and Lithography," in the "Paris
Sketch Book," describes the conditions of this period with the
following whimsical allegory:</p>

<p>"As for poor caricature and freedom of the press, they, like the

attendant, were entirely in the power of the giant who rules the
land. The Princess, the press, was so <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>(p. 68)</span> closely watched and
guarded (with some little show, nevertheless, of respect for her rank)
that she dared not utter a word of her own thoughts; and, as for poor
Caricature, he was gagged and put out of the way altogether."</p>

<p>On this famous 4th of November, however, there appeared the initial
number of Philipon's <i>La Caricature</i>, which was destined to usher in a
new era of comic art, and which proved the most efficacious weapon
which the Republicans found to use against Louis Philippe&mdash;a weapon as
redoubtable as <i>La Lanterne</i> of Henri Rochefort became under the
Second Empire. Like several of his most famous collaborators, Charles
Philipon was a Meridional. He was born in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>(p. 69)</span> Lyons at the
opening of the century. He studied art in the atelier of Gros. He
married into the family of an eminent publisher of prints, M. Aubert,
and was himself successively the editor of the three most famous comic
papers that France has had, <i>La Caricature</i>, <i>Charivari</i>, and the
<i>Journal pour Rire</i>. The first of these was a weekly paper. The
<i>Charivari</i> appeared daily, and at first its cartoons were almost
exclusively political. Philipon had gathered around him a group of
artists, men like Daumier, Gavarni, Henry Monnier, and Traviès, whose
names afterward became famous, and they united in a veritable crusade
of merciless ridicule against the king, his family, and his
supporters. Their satire took the form of bitter personal attacks, and
a very curious contest ensued between the government and the editorial
staff of the <i>Charivari</i>. As Thackeray sums it up, it was a struggle
between "half a dozen poor artists on the one side and His Majesty
Louis Philippe, his august family, and the numberless placemen and
supporters of the monarchy on the other; it was something like
Thersites girding at Ajax." Time after time were Philipon and his
dauntless aids arrested. More than a dozen times they lost their cause
before a jury, yet each defeat was equivalent to a victory, bringing
them new sympathy, and each time they returned to the attack with
cartoons <span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name="page71"></a>(p. 71)</span> which, if more covert in their meaning, were even
more offensive. Perhaps the most famous of all the cartoons which
originated in Philipon's fertile brain is that of the "Pear," which
did so much to turn the countenance of Louis Philippe to ridicule&mdash;a
ridicule which did more than anything else to cause him to be driven
from the French throne. The "Pear" was reproduced in various forms in
<i>La Caricature</i>, and afterward in <i>Le Charivari</i>. By inferior artists
the "Pear" was chalked up on walls all over Paris. The most
politically important of the "Poire" series was produced when Philipon
was obliged to appear before a jury to answer for the crime of
provoking contempt against the King's person by giving such a
ludicrous version of his face. In his own defense Philipon took up a
sheet of paper and drew a large Burgundy pear, in the lower parts
round and capacious, narrower near the stalk, and crowned with two or
three careless leaves. "Is there any treason in that?" he asked the
jury. Then he drew a second pear like the first, except that one or
two lines were scrawled in the midst of it, which bore somehow an odd
resemblance to the features of a celebrated personage; and, lastly, he
produced the exact portrait of Louis Philippe; the well-known
<i>toupet</i>, the ample whiskers&mdash;nothing was extenuated or set down
maliciously. "Gentlemen of the jury," said Philipon, "can I help it if
His Majesty's face is like a pear?" Thackeray, in giving an account of
this amusing trial, makes the curious error of supposing that
Philipon's <i>naïve</i> defense carried conviction with the jury. On the
contrary, Philipon was condemned and fined, and immediately took
vengeance upon the judge and jury by arranging their portraits upon
the front page of <i>Charivari</i> in the form of a "Pear." In a hundred
different ways his artists rang the changes upon the "pear," and each
new attack was the forerunner of a new <span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>(p. 72)</span> arrest and trial. One
day <i>La Caricature</i> published a design representing a gigantic pear
surmounting the pedestal in the Place de la Concorde, and bearing the
legend, "<i>Le monument expia-poire</i>." This regicidal pleasantry brought
Philipon once more into court. "The prosecution sees in this a
provocation to murder!" cried the accused. "It would be at most a
provocation to make marmalade." Finally, after a picture of a monkey
stealing a pear proved to be an indictable offense, the subject was
abandoned as being altogether too expensive a luxury.</p>

<p>But although the "Pear" was forced to disappear, Philipon continued to
harass the government, until Louis Philippe, who had gained his crown
largely by his championship of the freedom of the press, was driven in
desperation to sanction the famous September laws, which virtually
strangled its liberty. Yet, in spite of the obstacles thrown in their
way, the work of Philipon and of the remarkable corps of satirical
geniuses which he gathered round him, forms a pictorial record in
which the intimate history of France, from Charles X.'s famous <i>coup
d'état</i> down to the revolution of 1848, may be read like an open book.
The adversaries of the government of 1830 were of two kinds. One kind,
of which Admiral Carrel was a type, resorted to passionate argument,
to indignant eloquence. The other kind resorted to the methods of the
Fronde; they made war by pin-pricks, by bursts of laughter, with all
the resources of French gayety and wit. In this method the leading
spirit was Philipon, who understood clearly the power that would
result from the closest alliance between <i>la presse et l'image</i>. Even
before <i>La Caricature</i> was founded the features of the last of the
Bourbons became a familiar subject in cartoons. Invariably the same
features are emphasized; a tall, lank figure, frequently contorted
like the "india-rubber man" of the dime museums; a narrow, vacuous
countenance, a high, receding forehead, over which sparse locks of
hair are straggling; a salient jaw, the lips drawn back in a
mirthless grin, revealing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name="page75"></a>(p. 75)</span> huge, ungainly teeth, projecting
like the incisors of a horse. In one memorable cartoon he is expending
the full crushing power of these teeth upon the famous "charter" of
1830, but is finding it a nut quite too hard to crack.</p>

<p class="smaller">In this caricature Charles X. is attempting to break with his teeth a
billiard ball on which is written the word "Charter." The cartoon is
entitled "The Great Nutcracker of July 25th, or the Impotent
Horse-jaw" (ganache)&mdash;a play upon words.</p>
</div>

<p>From the very beginning <i>La Caricature</i> assumed an attitude of hostile
suspicion toward Louis Philippe, the pretended champion of the
<i>bourgeoisie</i>, whose veneer of expedient republicanism never went
deeper than to send his children to the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name="page76"></a>(p. 76)</span> public schools, and
to exhibit himself parading the streets of Paris, umbrella in hand.
Two cartoons which appeared in the early days of his reign, and are
labeled respectively "<i>Ne vous y frottez pas</i>" and "<i>Il va bon train,
le Ministère!</i>" admirably illustrate the public lack of confidence.
The first of these, an eloquent lithograph by Daumier, represents a
powerfully built and resolute young journeyman printer standing with
hands clinched, ready to defend the liberty of the press. In the
background are two groups. In the one Charles X., already worsted in
an encounter, lies prone upon the earth; in the other Louis Philippe,
waving his ubiquitous umbrella, is with difficulty restrained from
assuming the aggressive. The second of these cartoons is more sweeping
in its indictment. It represents the sovereign and his ministers in
their "chariot of state," one and all lashing the horses into a mad
gallop toward a bottomless abyss. General Soult, the Minister of War,
is flourishing and snapping a military flag, in place of a whip. At
the back of the chariot a Jesuit has succeeded in securing foothold
upon the baggage, and is adding his voice to hasten the forward march,
all symbolic of the violent momentum of the reactionary movement.</p>

<p>It was not likely that the part which Louis Philippe played in the
revolution of 1789, his share in the republican victories of Jemappes
and of Valmy, would be forgotten by those who saw in him only a
pseudo-republican, a "citizen king" in name only, and who seized
eagerly upon the opportunity of mocking at his youthful espousal of
republicanism. The names of these battles recur again and again in the
caricature of the period, in the legends, in maps conspicuously hung
upon the walls of the background. An anonymous cut represents the
public gazing eagerly into a magic lantern, the old "Poire"
officiating as showman: "You have before you <span class="pagenum"><a id="page78" name="page78"></a>(p. 78)</span> the conqueror of
Jemappes and of Valmy. You see him surrounded by his nobles, his
generals, and his family, all ready to die in his defense. See how the
jolly rascals fight. They are not the ones to be driven in disgrace
from their kingdom. Oh, no!" Of all the cartoons touching upon Louis
Philippe's insincerity, probably the most famous is that of Daumier
commemorating the death of Lafayette. The persistent popularity of
this veteran statesman had steadily become more and more embarrassing
to a government whose reactionary doctrines he repudiated, and whose
political corruption he despised. "<i>Enfoncé Lafayette!... Attrapé, mon
vieux!</i>" is the legend inscribed beneath what is unquestionably one of
the most extraordinary of all the caricatures of Honoré Daumier. It
represents Louis Philippe watching the funeral cortège of Lafayette,
his hands raised to his face in the pretense of grief, but the face
behind distorted into a hideous leer of gratification. M. Arsène
Alexandre, in his remarkable work on Daumier, describes this splendid
drawing in the following terms: "Under a grey sky, against the somber
and broken background of a cemetery, rises on a little hillock the fat
and black figure of an undertaker's man. Below him on a winding road
is proceeding a long funeral procession. It is the crowd that has
thronged to the obsequies of the illustrious patriot. Through the
leafage of the weeping willows may be seen the white tombstones. The
whole scene bears the mark of a profound sadness, in which the
principal figure seems to join, if one is to judge by his sorrowful
attitude and his clasped hands. But look closer. If this undertaker's
man, with the features of Louis Philippe, is clasping his hands, it is
simply to rub them together with joy; and through his fingers, half
hiding his countenance, one may detect a sly grin." The obsequious
attitude of the members <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80" name="page80"></a>(p. 80)</span> of Parliament came in for its share
of satirical abuse. "This is not a Chamber, it is a Kennel," is the
title of a spirited lithograph by Grandville, representing the French
statesmen as a pack of hounds fawning beneath the lash of their
imperious keeper, Casimir Périer. Another characteristic cartoon of
Grandville's represents the legislature as an "Infernal laboratory for
extracting the quintessence of politics"&mdash;a composition which, in its
crowded detail, its grim and uncanny suggestiveness, and above all its
<i>bizarre</i> distortions of the human face and form, shows more plainly
than the work of any other French caricaturist the influence of
Gillray. A collection of grinning skulls are labeled "Analysis of
Human Thought"; state documents of Louis Philippe are being cut and
weighed and triturated, while in the foreground a legislator with
distended cheeks is wasting an infinite lot of breath upon a blowpipe
in his effort to distill the much-sought-for quintessence from a
retort filled with fragments of the words "Bonapartism," "anarchy,"
"equality," "republic," etc. One of the palpable results of the
"political quintessence" of Louis Philippe's government took the form
of heavy imposts, and these also afforded a subject for Grandville's
graphic pencil. "The Public Thrown to the Imposts in the Great Pit of
the Budget" first appeared in <i>La Caricature</i>. It represented the
various taxes under which France was suffering in the guise of strange
and unearthly animals congregated in a sort of bear pit, somewhat
similar to the one which attracts the attention of all visitors to the
city of Berne. The spectacle is one given by the government in power
for the amusement of all those connected in any way with public
office: in other words, the salaried officials who draw their
livelihood from the taxes imposed upon the people. It is for their
entertainment that the tax-paying public is being hurled <span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>(p. 82)</span> to
the monsters below&mdash;monsters more uncouth and fantastic than even Mr.
H. G. Wells's fertile brain conceived in his "War of the Worlds," or
"First Men in the Moon." Daumier in his turn had to have his fling at
the ministerial benches of the government of July&mdash;the "prostituted
Chamber of 1834." At the present day, when the very names of the men
whom he attacked are half forgotten, his famous cartoon, "Le Ventre
Législatif," is still interesting; yet it is impossible to realize the
impression it must have made in the days when every one of those
"ventrigoulus," those rotund, somnolent, inanely smiling old men, with
the word "<i>bourgeoisie</i>" plainly written all over them, were familiar
figures in the political world, and Daumier's presentment of them, one
and all, a masterly indictment of complacent incapacity. As between
Daumier and Grandville, the two leading lights of <i>La Caricature</i>,
there is little question that the former was the greater. Balzac, who
was at one time one of the editors of <i>La Caricature</i>, writing under
pseudonym of "Comte Alexandre de B.," and was the source of
inspiration of one of its leading features, the curious <i>Etudes de
Genre</i>, once said of Daumier: "<i>Ce gaillard-là, mes enfants, a du
Michel-Ange sous la peau.</i>" Balzac took Daumier under his protection
from the beginning. His first counsel to him was: "If you wish to
become a great artist, <i>faites des dettes</i>!" Grandville has been
defined by later French critics as <i>un névrosé</i>, a bitter and
pessimistic soul. It was he who produced the cruelest compositions
that ever appeared in <i>La Caricature</i>. He had, however, some admirable
pages to his credit, among others his interpretation of Sebastian's
famous "L'Ordre règne à Varsovie." Fearfully sinister is the field of
carnage, with the Cossack, with bloody <i>pique</i>, mounting guard,
smoking his pipe tranquilly, on his face the horrible expression
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>(p. 84)</span> of satisfaction over a work well done. Grandville also
conceived the idea, worthy of a great cartoonist, of Processions and
Cortèges. These enabled him to have pass before the eye, under
costumes, each conveying some subtle irony or allusion, all the
political men in favor. Every occasion was good. A religious
procession, and the men of the day appeared as choir boys, as
acolytes, etc. <i>Un vote de budget</i>, and then it was <i>une marche de
b&oelig;uf gras</i>, with savages, musketeers, clowns forming the escort of
"<i>M. Gros, gras et bête</i>." It is easy to guess who was the
personage so designated. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>(p. 87)</span> Nothing is more amusing than these
pages, full of a <i>verve, soutenue de pince sans rire</i>.</p>

"Sister Press, do you see anything?"<br>
"Two Cavaliers, urging their horses across the plain, and bearing a

</div>

<p>It is one of the many little ironies of Louis Philippe's reign that,
after having owed his election to his supposed advocacy of freedom of
the press, he should in less than two years take vigorous measures to
stifle it. Some of the best known cartoons that appeared in <i>La
Caricature</i> deal with this very subject. One of these, which bears the
signature of Grandville and is marked by all the vindictive bitterness
of which that artist was the master, represents Louis Philippe in the
rôle of Bluebeard, who, dagger in hand, is about to slay his latest
wife. The wife, the "Constitution," lies prostrate, hound with thongs.
The corpses of this political Bluebeard's other victims may be seen
through the open door of the secret chamber. Leaning over the balcony
and scanning the horizon is the figure of Sister Anne, in this case
symbolic of the Press. The unfortunate "Constitution," feeling that
her last minute has come, calls out: "Sister Press, do you see nothing
coming?" The Press replies: "I see only the sun of July beating down,
powdering the dusty road and parching the green fields." Again the
Constitution cries: "Sister Press, do you see nothing coming?" And
this time the Press calls back: "I see two cavaliers urging their
horses across the plain and carrying a banner." Below the castle of
Bluebeard may be seen the figures of the two cavaliers. The banner
which they carry bears the significant word, "Republic!"</p>

<p>Another cartoon bearing upon the same subject represents Liberty
wearing a Phrygian cap, driving the chariot of the sun. The King and

<span class="smaller">MAYEUX AND ROBERT MACAIRE</span></h3>

<p>A peculiar feature of French caricature, especially after political
subjects were largely forbidden, was the creation of certain famous
types who soon became familiar to the French public, and whose
reappearances from day to day in new and ever grotesque situations
were hailed with growing delight. Such were the Mayeux of Traviès and
the Macaire and Bertrand of Daumier, who in course of time became as
celebrated, in a certain sense, as the heroes of "The Three
Musketeers." In his "Curiosités Esthétiques" Beaudelaire has told the
story of the origin of Mayeux. "There was," he says, "in Paris a sort
of clown named Le Claire, who had the run of various low resorts and
theaters. His specialty was to make <i>têtes d'expression</i>, that is, by
a series of facial contortions he would express successively the
various human passions. This man, a clown by nature, was very
melancholy and possessed with a mad desire for friendship. All the
time not occupied in practice and in giving his grotesque performances
he spent in searching for a friend, and when he had been drinking,
tears of solitude flowed freely from his eyes. Traviès saw him. It was
a time when the great patriotic enthusiasm of July was still at its
height. A luminous idea entered his brain. Mayeux was created, and for
a long time afterward this same turbulent Mayeux talked, screamed,
harangued, and gesticulated in the memory of the people of Paris."</p>

<p class="smaller">"Adam destroyed us by the apple; Lafayette by the pear."</p>
</div>

<p>In a hundred different guises, in the blue blouse of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name="page91"></a>(p. 91)</span>
workman, the apron of the butcher, the magisterial gown of judge or
advocate, this hunchback Mayeux, this misshapen parody upon humanity,
endeared himself to the Parisian public. Virulent, salacious, corrupt,
he was a sort of French Mr. Hyde&mdash;the shadow of secret weaknesses and
vices, lurking behind the Dr. Jekyll of smug <i>bourgeois</i>
respectability; and the French public recognized him as a true picture
of their baser selves. They laughed indulgently over the broad,
Rabelaisian jests that unfailingly accompanied each new <span class="pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>(p. 92)</span>
cartoon&mdash;jests which M. Dayot has admirably characterized as "seasoned
with coarse salt, more German than Gallic, and forming a series of
legends which might be made into a veritable catechism of
pornography." This Mayeux series is not, strictly speaking, political
in its essence. It touches upon all sides of life, without
discrimination and without respect. It even trespasses upon the
subject of that forbidden fruit, "Le Poire." In an oft-cited cartoon,
Mayeux with extended arms, his head sunken lower than usual between
his huddled shoulders, is declaiming: "Adam destroyed us with the
apple; Lafayette has destroyed us with the pear!" And later, when
repeated arrests, verdicts, fines, edicts had banished politics from
the arena of caricature, Mayeux was still a privileged character. Like
Chicot, the jester, who could speak his mind fearlessly to his
"Henriquet," while the ordinary courtier cringed obsequiously, Mayeux
shared the proverbial privilege of children and buffoons, to speak the
truth. And oftentimes it was not even necessary for his creator,
Traviès, to manifest any overt political significance; the public were
always more than ready to look for it below the surface. In such a
picture as that of Mayeux, in Napoleonic garb striking an attitude
before a portrait of the Little Corporal and exclaiming, "<i>Comme je
lui ressemble!</i>" they inevitably discovered a hint that there were
other hypocrites more august than Mayeux who fancied themselves worthy
of filling Napoleon's shoes.</p>

<p class="smaller">Messieurs Macaire and Bertrand have found it expedient
to make a hurried departure for Belgium for the purpose of evading
French justice. The eloquent Macaire, on reaching the frontier,
declaims as follows: "Hail to thee, O land of hospitality! Hail,
fatherland of those who haven't got any! Sacred refuge of all
unfortunates proscribed by human justice, hail! To all drooping hearts
Belgium is dear."</p>
</div>

<p>Even more famous than Mayeux are the Macaire and Bertrand series, the
joint invention of Philipon, who supplied the ideas and the text, and
of Daumier, who executed the designs. According to Thackeray, whose
analysis of these masterpieces of French caricature has become
classic, they had their origin in an old play, the "Auberge des
Adrets," in which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>(p. 94)</span> two thieves escaped from the galleys were
introduced, Robert Macaire, the clever rogue, and Bertrand, his
friend, the "butt and scapegoat on all occasions of danger." The play
had been half-forgotten when it was revived by a popular and clever
actor, Frederick Lemaïtre, who used it as a vehicle for political
burlesque. The play was suppressed, but <i>Le Charivari</i> eagerly seized
upon the idea and continued it from day to day in the form of a
pictorial puppet show, of which the public never seemed to weary.
Thackeray's summary of the characters of these two illustrious rascals
can scarcely be improved upon:</p>

<p class="smcap">Extinguished!</p>
</div>

<p>"M. Robert Macaire [he says] is a compound of Fielding's 'Blueskin'
and Goldsmith's 'Beau Tibbs.' He has the dirt and dandyism of the one,
with the ferocity of the other: sometimes he is made to swindle, but
where he can get a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>(p. 95)</span> shilling more, M. Macaire will murder
without scruple; he performs one and the other act (or any in the
scale between them) with a similar bland imperturbability, and
accompanies his actions with such philosophical remarks as may be
expected from a person of his talents, his energies, his amiable life
and character. Bertrand is the simple recipient of Macaire's jokes,
and makes vicarious atonement for his crimes, acting, in fact, the
part which pantaloon performs in the pantomime, who is entirely under
the fatal influence of clown. He is quite as much a rogue as that
gentleman, but he has not his genius and courage.... Thus Robert
Macaire and his companion Bertrand are made to go through the world;
both swindlers, but the one more accomplished than the other. Both
robbing all the world, and Robert robbing his friend, and, in the
event of danger, leaving him faithfully in the lurch. There is, in the
two characters, some grotesque good for the spectator&mdash;a kind of
'Beggars' Opera' moral.... And with these two types of clever and
stupid knavery, M. Philipon and his companion Daumier have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96" name="page96"></a>(p. 96)</span>
created a world of pleasant satire upon all the prevailing abuses of
the day."</p>

<p>The Macaire and Bertrand series were less directly political in their
scope than that of Traviès's hunchback; at least, their political
allusions were more carefully veiled. Yet the first of the series had
portrayed in Macaire's picturesque green coat and patched red trousers
no less a personage than the old "Poire" himself, and the public
remembered it. When politics were banished from journalism they
persisted in finding in each new escapade of Macaire and Bertrand an
allusion to some fresh scandal, if not connected with the King
himself, at least well up in the ranks of governmental hypocrites.
And, although the specific scandals upon which they are based, the
joint-stock schemes for floating worthless enterprises, the
thousand-and-one plausible humbugs of the period, are now forgotten,
to those who take the trouble to read between the lines, these
masterpieces of Daumier's genius form a luminous exposition of the
<i>morale</i> of the government and the court circles.</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM CRUIKSHANK TO LEECH</span></h3>

<p>In contrast with the brilliancy of the French artists, the work in
England during these years, at least prior to the establishment of
<i>Punch</i>, is distinctly disappointing. The one man who might have
raised caricature to an even higher level than that of Gillray and
Rowlandson was George Cruikshank, but he withdrew early in life from
political caricature, preferring, like Hogarth, to concentrate his
talent upon the dramatic aspects of contemporary social life. Yet at
the outset of his career, just as he was coming of age, Cruikshank
produced one cartoon that has remained famous because it anticipated
by thirty years the attitude of Mill and Cobden in 1846. It was in
1815, just after the battle of Waterloo had secured an era of peace
for Europe, that he produced his protest against the laws restricting
the importation of grain into England. He called it "The Blessings of
Peace; or, the Curse of the Corn Bill." A cargo of foreign grain has
just arrived and is being offered for sale by the supercargo: "Here is
the best for fifty shillings." On the shore a group of British
landholders wave the foreigner away: "We won't have it at any price.
We are determined to keep up our own to eighty shillings, and if the
poor can't buy it at that price, why, they must starve." In the
background a storehouse with tight-shut doors bulges with home-grown
grain. A starving family stand watching while the foreign grain is
thrown overboard, and the father says: "No, no, masters, I'll not
starve, but quit my native <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name="page98"></a>(p. 98)</span> land, where the poor are crushed
by those they labor to support, and retire to one more hospitable, and
where the arts of the rich do not interpose to defeat the providence
of God."</p>

<p>After Cruikshank, until the advent of the men who made <i>Punch</i>
famous,&mdash;Richard Doyle, John Leech, John Tenniel, and their
successors,&mdash;there are no cartoonists in England whose work rises
above mediocrity. When the death of Canning brought Wellington and
Peel into power, a series of colored prints bearing the signature H.
Heath, and persistently lampooning the new ministry, enjoyed a certain
vogue. They scarcely rose above the level of the penny comic
valentine, which they much resembled in crudeness of color and poverty
of invention. One set, entitled "Our Theatrical Celebrities," depicted
the Premier as stage manager, the other members of the cabinet as
leading man, première danseuse, prompter, etc. Another series depicts
the same statesmen as so many thoroughbreds, to be auctioned off to
the highest bidder, and describes the good points of each in the most
approved language of the turf. Lot No. 1 is the Duke of Wellington,
described as "the famous charger, Arthur"; Lot No. 2 is Peel, the
"Good Old Cobb, Bobby," and the rest of the series continue the same
vein of inane witticism. Somewhat more point is to be found in the
portrayal of Wellington buried up to his neck in his own boot&mdash;one of
the universal Wellington boots of the period. The cartoonist's
thought, quite obviously, was that the illustrious hero of Waterloo
had won his fame primarily in boots and spurs, and that as a statesman
he became a very much shrunken and insignificant figure. In its
underlying thought this cartoon suggests comparison with the familiar
"Grandpa's Hat" cartoons of the recent Harrison administration. Very
rarely Heath broke away from home politics and touched upon
international <span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name="page99"></a>(p. 99)</span> questions of the day. A print showing the
Premier engaged in the task of "making a rushlight," which he is just
withdrawing cautiously from a large tub labeled "Greece," is an
allusion to the part played by Great Britain in helping to add the
modest light of Greek independence to the general illumination of
civilized Europe.</p>

</div>

<p>Another man whose work enjoyed a long period of shop-window
popularity, and who nevertheless did not always rise above the
comic-valentine level, was John Doyle, who owes his memory less to his
own work than to the fact that he was the father of a real master of
the art, Richard Doyle. Parton, in his history of "Caricature and
Other Comic Art," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100"></a>(p. 100)</span> notes the elder Doyle's remarkable
prolificness, estimating his collected prints at upward of nine
hundred; and he continues: "It was a custom with English print-sellers
to keep portfolios of his innocent and amusing pictures to let out by
the evening to families about to engage in the arduous work of
entertaining their friends at dinner. He excelled greatly in his
portraits, many of which, it is said by contemporaries, are the best
ever taken of the noted men of that day, and may safely be accepted as
historical. Brougham, Peel, O'Connell, Hume, Russell, Palmerston, and
others appear in his works as they were in their prime, with little
distortion or exaggeration, the humor of the pictures being in the
situation portrayed. Thus, after a debate in which allusion was made
to an ancient egg anecdote, Doyle produced a caricature in which the
leaders of parties were drawn as hens sitting upon eggs. The whole
interest of the picture lies in the speaking likeness of the men."</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>(p. 101)</span> CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="smaller">THE BEGINNING OF "PUNCH"</span></h3>

<p>What the advent of <i>La Caricature</i> did for French comic art was done
for England by the birth of <i>Punch</i>, the "London Charivari," on July
17, 1841. It is not surprising that this veteran organ of wit and
satire, essentially British though it is in the quality and range of
its humor, should have inspired a number of different writers
successively to record its annals. Mr. M. H. Spielmann, whose
admirable volume is likely to remain the authoritative history, points
out that the very term "cartoon" in its modern sense is in reality a
creation of <i>Punch's</i>. In the reign of Charles I., he says, the
approved phrase was, "a mad designe"; in the time of George II. it was
known as a "hieroglyphic"; throughout the golden age of Gillray and
Cruikshank "caricature" was the epithet applied to the separate
copperplate broadsides displayed in the famous shops of Ackermann,
Mrs. Humphrey, and McClean. But it was not until July, 1843, when the
first great exhibition of cartoons for the Houses of Parliament was
held&mdash;gigantic designs handling the loftiest subjects in the most
elevated artistic spirit&mdash;that <i>Punch</i> inaugurated his own sarcastic
series of "cartoons," and by doing so permanently enriched the
language with a new word, or rather with new meaning for an old word.
<i>Punch</i>, however, did far more than merely to change the terminology
of caricature, he revolutionized its spirit; he made it possible for
Gladstone to say of it that "in his early days, when an artist was
engaged to produce political <span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102"></a>(p. 102)</span> satires, he nearly always
descended to gross personal caricature, and sometimes to indecency.
To-day the humorous press showed a total absence of vulgarity and a
fairer treatment, which made this department of warfare always
pleasing."</p>

<p>As in the case of other famous characters of history, the origin and
parentage of <i>Punch</i> have been much disputed, and a variety of legends
have grown up about the source of its very name, the credit for its
genesis being variously assigned to its original editors, Henry
Mayhew, Mark Lemon, the printer Joseph Last, the writer Douglas
Jerrold, and a number of obscurer literary lights. One story cited by
Mr. Spielmann, although clearly apocryphal, is nevertheless worthy of
repetition. According to this story, somebody at one of the
preliminary meetings spoke of the forthcoming paper as being like a
good mixture of punch, good for nothing without Lemon, when Mayhew
caught up the idea and cried, "A capital idea! We'll call it <i>Punch</i>!"</p>

<p>In marked contrast to its French prototype, the "London Charivari" was
from the beginning a moderate organ, and a stanch supporter of the
Crown. In its original prospectus its political creed was outlined as
follows: "<i>Punch</i> has no party prejudices; he is conservative in his
opposition to Fantoccini and political puppets, but a progressive whig
in his love of <i>small change</i> and a repeal of the union with public
Judies." And to this day this policy of "hitting all around," of
avoiding any bitter and prolonged partisanship, is the keynote of
<i>Punch's</i> popularity and prestige. How this attitude has been
consistently maintained in its practical working is well brought out
by Mr. Spielmann in his chapter dedicated to the periodic <i>Punch</i>
dinners, where the editorial councils have always taken place:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103"></a>(p. 103)</span> "When the meal is done and cigars and pipes are duly lighted,
subjects are deliberately proposed in half a dozen quarters, until
quite a number may be before the Staff. They are fought all round the
Table, and unless obviously and strikingly good, are probably rejected
or attacked with good-humored ridicule or withering scorn.... And when
the subject of a cartoon is a political one, the debate grows hot and
the fun more furious, and it usually ends by Tories and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>(p. 104)</span>
Radicals accepting a compromise, for the parties are pretty evenly
balanced at the Table; while Mr. Burnand assails both sides with
perfect indifference. At last, when the intellectual tug-of-war,
lasting usually from half-past eight for just an hour and
three-quarters by the clock, is brought to a conclusion, the cartoon
in all its details is discussed and determined; and then comes the
fight over the title and the 'cackle,' amid all the good-natured chaff
and banter of a pack of boisterous, high-spirited schoolboys."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>(p. 105)</span> Down to the close of the period covered in the present
chapter, the cartoon played a relatively small part in the weekly
contents of <i>Punch</i>, averaging barely one a week, and being omitted
altogether from many numbers. During these years the dominating spirit
was unquestionably John Leech, who produced no less than two hundred
and twenty-three cartoons out of a total of three hundred and
fourteen, or more <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>(p. 106)</span> than twice as many as all the other
contributors put together. He first appeared with a pageful of
"Foreign Affairs" in the fourth issue of <i>Punch</i>&mdash;a picture of some
huddled groups of foreign refugees&mdash;a design remembered chiefly
because it for the first time introduced to the world the artist's
sign-manual, a leech wriggling in a water bottle.</p>

<p>Of Doyle's political plates during these early years, none is more
interesting to the American reader than the few rare occasions upon
which he seeks to express the British impression of the United States.
One of these, "The Land of Liberty," appeared in 1847. A lean and
lanky, but beardless, Uncle Sam tilts lazily back in his
rocking-chair, a six-shooter in his hand, a huge cigar between his
teeth. One foot rests carelessly upon a bust of Washington, which he
has kicked over. The other is flung over the back of another chair in
sprawling insolence. In the ascending clouds of smoke appear the Stars
and Stripes, surrounded by a panorama of outrages, duels, barroom
broils, lynch law, etc., and above them all, the contending armies of
the Mexican war, over whom a gigantic devil hovers, his hands extended
in a malignant benediction. A closely analogous cartoon of this same
year by Richard Doyle sharply satirized Louis Philippe as the
"Napoleon of Peace," and depicted in detail the unsatisfactory
condition of European affairs as seen from the British vantage ground.
As a consequence of this cartoon <i>Punch</i> was for some time excluded
from Paris.</p>

<p>From 1848 onward the cartoons in <i>Punch</i> look upon the world politics
from a constantly widening angle. Indeed, the same remark holds good
for the comic organs not only of England, but of France, Germany,
Italy, and the other leading nations as well. Throughout the second
half of the nineteenth century the international relations of the
leading <span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>(p. 108)</span> powers may be followed almost without a break in the
cartoons of <i>Punch</i> and <i>Judy</i>, of the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> and the

<i>Life</i> and <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i>, and the countless host of their

</div>

<p>The close of the first half of the nineteenth century marks a
convenient moment for a backward glance. These fifty years, which
began with the consulship of the first Napoleon and closed on the eve
of the third Napoleon's <i>coup d'état</i>, witnessed the rise and fall of
more than one Napoleonic spirit in the realm of comic art. It was
essentially a period of individualism, of the one-man power in
caricature. Existing conditions forbade a logical and unbroken
development of the political cartoon; it evolved only by fits and
starts. It was often less an expression of the popular mood than a
vehicle for personal enthusiasm or personal rancor; at the hands of
just a few masters, it verged upon the despotic. At intervals, first
in one country and then in another, a Gillray, a Rowlandson, a
Daumier, would blaze forth, brilliant, erratic, meteor-like, leaving
behind them a trail of scintillating suggestion, destined to fire some
new fuse, to start caricature along some new curve of eccentricity.
The importance of these fifty years, the lasting influence of these
forerunners of the modern cartoonists, must not be underrated. Without
the inspiration of their brilliant successes, and, it may also be
added, the useful lessons of their errors and failures, the cartoon of
to-day would be radically different, and probably greatly inferior to
what it is. Above all, they taught, by two tremendous object lessons,
the potent force that lies in pictorial satire&mdash;by the share which
English cartoonists had in the overthrow of Napoleon I., and which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>(p. 112)</span> French cartoonists had in the downfall of Louis Philippe. But
it was only with the advent of the modern comic weekly of the high
type represented by <i>Punch</i> that it became possible to develop schools
of caricature with definite aims and established traditions&mdash;schools
that have tended steadily to eliminate and reject the old-time
elements of vulgarity and exaggeration, to gain the increased
influence that comes from sobriety of method and higher artistic
excellence, and to hold erratic individuality in check. Few people
who are not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>(p. 113)</span> directly concerned in its making ever realize how
essentially the modern caricature is a composite production. Take, for
example, the big, double-page cartoon which has become such a familiar
weekly feature in <i>Puck</i> or <i>Judge</i>, with its complicated group of
figures, its suggestive background, its multitude of clever minor
points; the germ idea has been picked out from perhaps a dozen others,
as the result of careful deliberation, and from this starting point
the whole design has been built up, detail by detail, representing the
joint cleverness of the entire editorial staff. But the collaboration
reaches further back than this. A political cartoon resembles in a way
a composite photograph, which embodies not merely the superimposed
features of the men who sat before the camera, but something also of
the countless generations before them, who have made their features
what they are by transmitting from father to son something of their
own personality. In the same way, the political cartoon of to-day is
the product of a gradual evolution, mirroring back the familiar
features of many a cartoon of the past. It is not merely an embodiment
of the ideas of the satirists who suggested it and the artist who drew
it, but also of many a traditional and stereotyped symbol, bequeathed
from generation to generation by artists dead and gone. The very
essence of pictorial satire, its alpha and omega, so to speak, is
symbolism, the use of certain established types, conventional
personifications of Peace and War, Death and Famine and Disease,
Father Time with his scythe, the Old Year and the New; the Russian
Bear, the British Lion, and the American Eagle; Uncle Sam and
Columbia, Britannia and John Bull. These figures, as we have them
to-day, cannot point to any one creator. They are not an inspiration
of the moment, a stroke of genius, like Daumier's "Macaire" or
Traviès's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114"></a>(p. 114)</span> "Mayeux." They are the product of a century of
evolution, a gradual survival of the fittest, resulting from the
unconscious natural selection of popular approval. No better specific
instance can be taken than that of the familiar figure of John Bull as
he appears from week to week in the contemporary pages of <i>Punch</i>, for
his descent may be traced in an unbroken line&mdash;there are no missing
links. No single British caricaturist, from Gillray to Du Maurier, can
claim the credit for having invented him; yet each in his turn has
contributed something, a touch here, a line there, toward making him
what he is to-day. As Mr. Spielmann has pointed out, the earliest
prototype of <i>Punch's</i> John Bull is to be sought in Gillray's
conception of "Farmer George," that figured in a long series of
malevolent caricatures depicting George III., as a gaping country
lout, a heavy, dull-witted yokel. There is no more curious paradox in
the history of caricature than that this figure of "Farmer George,"
conceived in pure malice as a means of inspiring resentment against a
king popularly believed to care more for his farmyard than for the
interests of his subjects, should by gradual transition have come to
be accepted as the symbolic figure of the nation. Yet the successive
steps are easy enough to understand. When Gillray's point of attack
had shifted from the throne of England to the throne of France, his
type of "Farmer George" needed but slight modification to become a
huge, ungainly ogre, the incarnation of British wrath against "Little
Boney"&mdash;shaking a formidable fist at the coast of Calais, wading
knee-deep across the channel, or greedily opening a cavernous jaw to
take in a soul-satisfying meal of French frigates. But beneath the
exaggerated ferocity of Gillray's extreme type, the idea of a farmer
as the national figure is never quite lost sight of. In Gillray's
later <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>(p. 116)</span> cartoons the conception of John Bull had already taken
on a more consistent and definite form. At the hands of Rowlandson and
Woodward he lost much of his uncouthness and began to assume a
mellower and more benignant aspect; a cartoon by the latter, entitled
"Genial Rays," pictures him reclining luxuriously upon a bed of roses,
basking in "the sun of patriotism," the image of agricultural
contentment. A certain coarseness and vulgarity, however, clung to him
until well down into the forties, when the refining touch of Leech and
Tenniel gradually idealized him into the portly, choleric, well-to-do
rural gentleman who is to-day such a familiar figure the world over.
This type of John Bull as the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>(p. 117)</span> representative Briton once
called forth some thoroughly characteristic comments from John Ruskin.
"Is it not surely," he asks, "some overruling power in the nature of
things, quite other than the desire of his readers, which compels Mr.
Punch, when the squire, the colonel, and the admiral are to be at once
expressed, together with all that they legislate or fight for, in the
symbolic figure of the nation, to present the incarnate Mr. Bull
always as a farmer&mdash;never as a manufacturer or shopkeeper?" Such a
view on the part of Mr. Ruskin is consistent with his life-long
insistence upon literal truth in art. But he was obviously mistaken
when he questioned that John Bull is the deliberate choice of the
British public. The average Englishman, whether soldier or sailor,
statesman, merchant, or manufacturer, approves and enjoys the pleasant
fiction that the representative type is a good, old-fashioned country
gentleman, conservative and rather insular, a supporter of landed
interests, a patron of country sports; in short, one who lives his
life close to his native soil, who seems to personify the rolling
down, the close-clipped hedge, the trim gardenplot, the neat thatched
roof, things which typify England the world over.</p>

<p>Not only are most of the accepted symbolic figures&mdash;John Bull, Uncle
Sam, and the rest&mdash;what they are because they meet with popular
approval, but no cartoonist to-day could venture upon any radical
departure from the established type&mdash;a bearded John Bull, a
smooth-shaven Uncle Sam&mdash;without calling down public disfavor upon his
head. If one stops to think of it, our own accepted national type, the
tall, lank, awkward figure, the thin, angular Yankee face with a
shrewd and kindly twinkle in the eye, is even less representative of
the average American than John Bull is of the average Briton. It is
interesting to recall that before the Civil War <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>(p. 118)</span> our national
type frequently took the form of a Southerner&mdash;regularly in the pages
of <i>Punch</i>. To-day, in England and in America, there is but one type
of Uncle Sam, and we would not tolerate a change. It may be that in
the gaunt, loose-knit frame, the strong and rugged features we
recognize a kinship to that sterling and essentially American type of
man which found its best exponent in Lincoln, and that this is the
reason why Uncle Sam has become the most universally accepted and the
best beloved of all our conventional types.</p>

<span class="smaller">'48 AND THE COUP D'ÉTAT</span></h3>

<p>It was only natural that caricature, like every other form of free
expression of opinion, should feel the consequences of the general
political upheaval of 1848; and these consequences differed widely in
the different countries of Europe, according to the degree of civic
liberty which that revolutionary movement had effected. In Germany,
for example, it resulted in the establishment of a whole group of
comic weeklies, with a license for touching upon political topics
quite unprecedented in that land of imperialism and censorship. In
France, on the contrary, political caricature came to an abrupt close
just at a time when it had begun to give promise of exceptional
interest. Louis Napoleon, who owed his elevation to the presidency of
the republic chiefly to the popular belief in his absolute
harmlessness, developed a most unexpected and disconcerting strength
of character. His capacity for cunning and unscrupulousness was yet to
be learned; but a feeling of distrust was already in the air, and the
caricaturists were quick to reflect it. Louis Napoleon, however, was
keenly alive to the deadly harm wrought to his predecessor by
Philipon's pictorial sharp-shooters, and he did not propose to let
history repeat itself by holding him up to public ridicule, after the
fashion of the poor old "Poire," the citizen king. Accordingly the
<i>coup d'état</i> was hardly an accomplished fact when press laws were
passed of such a stringent nature that the public press, and pictorial
satire along with it, was reduced to a state of vassalage, dependent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120"></a>(p. 120)</span> upon the imperial caprice, a condition that lasted upward of
fifteen years. Consequently, the few cartoons satirizing Napoleon
III., that emanate from French sources, either belong to the closing
years of his reign or else antedate the law of 1851, which denied
trial by jury to all cases of infringement of the press laws. The
latter cartoons, however, are of special interest, for they serve to
throw important light upon the popular state of mind just prior to the
famous <i>coup d'état</i>.</p>

<p>The majority of these cartoons appeared in the pages of <i>Charivari</i>,
and some of the best are due to the caustic pencil of Charles Vernier.
A good specimen of this artist's work is a lithograph entitled "The
Only Lamps Authorized for the Present to Light up the Path of the
Government," showing Louis Napoleon marching along sedately, his hands
clasped behind his back and his way illuminated by three <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>(p. 121)</span>
lantern-bearers. The lanterns are, respectively, <i>La Patrie du Soir</i>,
<i>Le Moniteur du Soir</i> and <i>La Gazette de France</i>, newspapers then in
favor with the government. Just in front of Louis Napoleon, however,
may be seen a dark and ominous manhole. Another of Vernier's cartoons
is called "The Shooting Match in the Champs Élysées." The target is
the head of the Constitution surmounting a pole. Napoleon is directing
the efforts of the contestants. "The man who knocks the target over
completely," he is saying, "I will make my Prime Minister." The
contrast between the great Napoleon and the man whom Victor Hugo liked
so to call "Napoleon the Little" suggested another pictorial effort of
Vernier. A veteran of the Grand Army is watching the coach of the
state passing by, Napoleon holding the reins. "What! That my Emperor!"
exclaims the veteran, shading his eyes. "Those rascally Englishmen,
how they have changed my vision!" The methods by which Louis Napoleon
obtained his election first as President for ten years, and secondly
as Emperor of the French, were satirized in <i>Charivari</i> by Daumier in
a cartoon called "Les Aveugles" (The Blind). In the center of this
cartoon is a huge ballot jar <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>(p. 122)</span> marked "Universal Suffrage."
Around this the sightless voters are laboriously groping.</p>

<p>Many were the designs by which Daumier in <i>Charivari</i> satirized Louis
Napoleon's flirtation with the French republic. In one of them the
Prince, bearing a remote resemblance in manner and in dress to Robert
Macaire, is offering the lady his arm. "<i>Belle dame</i>," he is saying,
"will you accept my escort?" To which she replies coldly: "Monsieur,
your passion is entirely too sudden. I can place no great faith in

<p>Pictorial expressions of opinion regarding the "great crime" of 1851,
which once more replaced a republic with an empire, must be sought for
outside of France. But there was one subject at this time upon which
even the strictest of edicts could not enforce silence, and that was
the subject of Napoleon's marriage to Eugénie. The Emperor's Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>(p. 123)</span> bride was never popular, not even during the first years of
the Second Empire, before she began to meddle with affairs of state;
and in many incisive ways the Parisians heaped ridicule upon her. A
curious little pamphlet, with text and illustrations, about the new
Empress was sold in Paris at the time of the marriage. This pamphlet
was entirely complimentary and harmless. The biting humor of it was on
the title-page, which the vendors went about crying in the streets:
"The portrait and virtues of the Empress, all for two sous!" But for a
frank expression of what the world thought of the new master of the
destinies of France, it is necessary to turn to the contemporary pages
of <i>Punch</i>. The "London Charivari" was at this time just entering upon
its most glorious epoch of political caricature. John Leech, one of
the two great English cartoonists of the past half century, had
arrived at the maturity of his talent; the second, John Tenniel, was
destined soon to join the staff of <i>Punch</i> in place of Richard Doyle,
who resigned in protest against the editorial policy of attacking the
Roman Catholic Church. Both of these artists possessed a technical
skill and a degree of artistic inspiration that raised them far above
the level of the mere caricaturist. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>(p. 124)</span> And as it happened, the
world was entering upon a long succession of stormy scenes, destined
to furnish them with matter worthy of their pencils. After forty years
of peace, Europe was about to incur an epidemic of war. The clash
between Turkey and Russia in 1853 was destined to assume international
proportions in the Crimean War; England's troubles were to be
augmented by the revolt of her Indian mercenaries; the Russian war was
to be closely followed by another between France and Austria; by the
enfranchisement of Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic; the bitter
struggle between Prussia and Austria; and the breaking up of the
Confederation of the Rhine, with the Franco-Prussian War looming up in
the near future. It was on the threshold of such troublous times, and
as if prophetic of the end of European tranquillity, that Leech
signalized the accession of Napoleon III. as Emperor with the
significant cartoon, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>(p. 125)</span> "France is Tranquil!!!" Poor France
cannot well be otherwise than tranquil, for Mr. Leech depicts her
bound hand and foot, a chain-shot fastened to her feet and a sentry
standing guard over her with a bayonet. The artist soon followed this
up with another cartoon, evidently suggested by the initial plate of
Hogarth's famous series of "The Rake's Progress." The Prince
President, in the character of the Rake, has just come into his
inheritance, and has cast aside his former mistress, Liberté, to whom
he is offering money, her mother (France) standing by, an indignant
witness to the scene. His military tailor is measuring him for a new
imperial uniform, while behind him a priest (in allusion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>(p. 126)</span> financial aid which the Papal party was receiving from
Napoleon) is helping himself from a plate of money standing beside the
President. On the floor is a confused litter of swords, knapsacks,
bayonets, crowns, crosses of the Legion of Honor, the Code Napoléon,
and other miscellaneous reminders of Louis' well-known craze on the
subject of his uncle and his uncle's ideas. Mr. Tenniel's early
cartoons of Louis Napoleon are scarcely more kindly. The Emperor's
approaching marriage is hit off in one entitled "The Eagle in Love,"
in which Eugénie, represented with the most unflattering likeness, is
employed in paring the imperial eagle's talons. In 1853 Tenniel
depicts an "International Poultry Show," where we see among the
entries a variety of eagles&mdash;the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127"></a>(p. 127)</span> Prussian eagle, the American
eagle, the two-headed Russian and Austrian eagles&mdash;and among them a
wretched mongrel, more closely akin to a bedraggled barn-door fowl
than to the "French Eagle" which it claims to be. Queen Victoria, who
is visiting the show, under escort of Mr. Punch, remarks: "We have
nothing of that sort, Mr. Punch; but should there be a <i>lion</i> show, we
can send a specimen!!"</p>

</div>

<p>The grim struggle of the Crimean War for a time checked Mr. Punch's
attacks upon Napoleon III., and turned his attention in another
direction. Although the war cloud in the East was assuming portentous
dimensions, there were many in England, the Peace Society, the members
of the peace-at-any-price party, with Messrs. Bright and Cobden at
their head, and most conspicuous of all the Prime Minister, Lord
Aberdeen, who deliberately blinded themselves to the possibility of
war. It was for the enlightenment of these gentlemen that Mr. Leech
designed his cartoon "No Danger," representing a donkey, eloquent in
his stolid stupidity, tranquilly braying in front of a loaded cannon.
In still another cartoon Lord Aberdeen himself is placidly smoking
"The Pipe of Peace" over a brimming barrel of gunpowder. John Bull,
however, has already become wide-awake to the danger, for he is
nailing the Russian eagle to his barn door, remarking to his French
neighbor that <i>he</i> won't worry the Turkies any more. At this time
England had begun to watch with growing jealousy the cordial <i>entente</i>
between Russia and Austria, for the Emperor Nicholas was strongly
suspected of having offered to Austria a slice of his prospective
prize, Turkey. This rumor forms the basis of an effective cartoon by
Leech, "The Old 'Un and the Young 'Un," in which the Russian and
Austrian Emperors are seated at table, genially dividing a bottle of
port between them. "Now then, Austria," says Nicholas, "just help me
finish <span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>(p. 129)</span> the Port(e)." Meanwhile, hostilities between Turkey
and Russia had begun, and the latter had already received a serious
setback at Oltenitza, an event commemorated by Tenniel in his cartoon
of "A Bear with a Sore Head." In spite of his blind optimism, Lord
Aberdeen was by this time finding it decidedly difficult to handle the
reins of foreign affairs. One of the best satires of the year is by
Tenniel, entitled "The Unpopular Act of the Courier of St.
Petersburg," depicting Aberdeen performing the dangerous feat of
driving a team of vicious horses. The mettlesome leaders, Russia and
Turkey, have already taken the bit between their teeth, while Austria,
catching the contagion of their viciousness, is plunging dangerously.
This cartoon was soon followed by another still more notable, entitled
"What It Has Come To," one of those splendid animal pictures in which
John Tenniel especially excelled. It shows us the Russian bear,
scampering off in the distance, while in the foreground Lord Aberdeen
is clinging desperately to the British lion, which has started in mad
pursuit, with his mane erect and his tail stiffened like a ramrod; the
lion plunges along, dragging behind him the terrified premier, who is
gasping out that he can no longer hold him and is forced to "let him
go." At the same time Mr. Leech also represented pictorially Lord
Aberdeen awakening to the necessity of war in his "Bombardment of
Odessa." The cartoon is in two parts, representing respectively the
English Premier and the Russian Emperor reading their morning paper.
"Bombardment of Odessa," says Aberdeen. "Dear me, this will be very
disagreeable to my imperial friend." "Bombardment of Odessa," says
Nicholas; "confound it! This will be very annoying to dear old
Aberdeen!" In the following November the British victory of Inkerman,
won against almost <span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>(p. 130)</span> hopeless odds, was witnessed by two
members of the Russian imperial family. Leech promptly commemorated
this fact in his picture of "The Russian Bear's Licked Cubs, Nicholas
and Michael." The cartoon entitled the "Bursting of the Russian
Bubble" appeared in <i>Punch</i>, October 14, 1854, just after the battle
of the Alma had taken place and part of the Russian fleet had been
destroyed by the English and French ships at Sebastopol. This cartoon
is by the hand of Leech. The Russian Emperor, Nicholas I., had boasted
of the "irresistible power" which was to enable him to overthrow the
allied forces gathered in the Crimea, and here the artist shows very
graphically the shattering of this "irresistible power" and of the
"unlimited means." Of all the cartoons which Leech produced there is
none which enjoys a more enduring fame than the one entitled "General
Février <span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>(p. 131)</span> Turned Traitor." Certainly no other in the whole
series of Crimean War cartoons appearing in <i>Punch</i> compares with it
in power. Yet splendid and effective as it is, there is in it a
cruelty worthy of Grandville or Gillray, and when it appeared it
caused a shudder to run through all England. The Russian Emperor had
boasted in a speech on the subject of the Crimean War that, whatever
forces France and England might be able to send to the front, Russia
possessed two generals on whom she could always rely, General Janvier
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>(p. 132)</span> General Février. In other words, Nicholas I. cynically
alluded to the hardship of the Russian winter, on which he counted to
reduce greatly by death the armies of the Allies in the Crimea. But
toward the end of the winter, the Emperor himself died of pulmonary
apoplexy, after an attack of influenza. In a flash, Leech seized upon
the idea. <i>General Février had turned traitor.</i> Under this title, the
cartoon was published by <i>Punch</i> in its issue of March 10, 1855.
General Février (Death in the uniform of a Russian general) is placing
his deadly hand on the breast of Nicholas, and the icy cold of the
Russian winter&mdash;the ally in whom the Emperor had placed his trust&mdash;has
recoiled upon himself. The tragic dignity and grim significance of
this cartoon made a deep impression upon Ruskin, who regarded it as
representing in the art of caricature what Hood's "Song of the Shirt"
represents in poetry. "The reception of the last-named woodcut," he
says, "was in several respects a curious test of modern feeling ...
There are some points to be regretted in the execution of the design,
but the thought was a grand one; the memory of the word spoken and of
its answer could hardly in any more impressive way have been recorded
for the people; and I believe that to all persons accustomed to the
earnest forms of art it contained a profound and touching lesson. The
notable thing was, however, that it offended persons <i>not</i> in earnest,
and was loudly cried out against by the polite journalism of Society.
This fate is, I believe, the almost inevitable one of thoroughly
genuine work in these days, whether poetry or painting; but what added
to the singularity in this case was that coarse heartlessness was even
more offended than polite heartlessness."</p>

</div>

<p>As was but natural, the Anglo-French alliance against Russia is
alluded to in more than one of Mr. Punch's Crimean <span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>(p. 134)</span> War
cartoons. One of the earliest is a drawing by Tenniel of England and
France typified by two fine specimens of Guards of both nations
standing back to back in friendly rivalry of height, and Mr. Spielmann
records in his "History of Punch" that the cut proved so popular that
under its title of "The United Service:" it was reproduced broadcast
on many articles of current use and even served as a decoration for
the backs of playing cards. Still another cartoon, entitled "The Split
Crow in the Crimea," represents England and France as two huntsmen,
hard on the track of a wounded and fleeing two-headed bird! "He's hit
hard!&mdash;follow him up!" exclaimed the huntsmen. In a French
reproduction of this cartoon, which is to be found in Armand Dayot's
"Le Second Empire," "Crow" is amusingly translated as <i>couronne</i>
(crown), and the publishers of <i>Punch</i> are given as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>(p. 135)</span> "MM.
Breadburg, Agnew, et Cie." Another cartoon of the same period is
called "Brothers in Arms." It shows a British soldier carrying on his
back a wounded French soldier, and a French soldier carrying on his
back a wounded Englishman. The two wounded men are clasping hands.
There is no better evidence of the utter dearth of French caricature
at this period than the fact that M. Dayot, whose indefatigable
research has brought together a highly interesting collection of
pictorial documents of all classes upon this period of French history,
could find nothing in the way of a cartoon in his own country and was
forced to borrow from <i>Punch</i> the few that he reproduces.</p>

<p>On the other side the Russian cartoonists were by no means backward in
recording the events of the war and holding up the efforts of the
Allies to pictorial derision. The Russian point of view has come down
to us in a series of excellent prints published in St. Petersburg
during the months of the conflict. In this warfare the Russians may be
said to have borrowed from their enemies, for this series is
essentially French in method and execution. All through this series
England and France are shown buffeted about from pillar to post by the
Conquering Bear. A description of one of these cartoons will give a
fair general idea of the entire series. Sir Charles Napier, at a
dinner given in his honor in London just before the departure of the
Allied fleet for Kronstadt, has made the foolish boast that he would
soon invite his hosts to dine with him in St. Petersburg. Of course
the fleet never reached St. Petersburg, and the Russian artist
satirically summed up the situation by depicting Sir Charles at the
top of the mast, endeavoring by the aid of a large spy-glass to catch
a sight of the Czar's capital.</p>

Crimean War was not forgotten. A rather rare cartoon, entitled
"Turkey, John Bull and M. Frog-Eater in a Bad Fix," is especially
interesting as an evidence that American sympathy during the war was
in a measure on the Russian side. The Russian General Menshikoff is
standing on the heights of Sebastopol looking down smilingly and
serenely on the discomfited allies, saying: "How do you do, gentlemen?
Very happy to see you. You must be tired. Won't you walk in and take
something?" John Bull, seriously wounded, is lying prostrate, bawling
out: "Come, come, Turk, no dodging. Hulloa there! Is that the way you
stick to your friends? The coat of my stomach is ruined, my wind
nearly gone. I won't be able to blow for a month. Pull me out of this
at any price! The devil take one party and his dam the other. I am
getting sick of this business." By his side is the figure of a
Frenchman just hit by a cannon-ball from one of the Russian guns, and
crying out: "O! By damn! I not like such treat. I come tousand mile
and spend ver much money to take someting from wid you, and you treat
me as I vas van Villin! Scoundrel! Robbare!!"</p>

<p>In closing the subject of the Crimean War, it is worth while to call
attention to one curious phase of the war as contained in the
programme of a theatrical entertainment given by the French soldiers
in the trenches of Sebastopol, December 23, 1855. The programme is
headed "The Little Comic Review of the Crimea." It contains the
announcement of the Tchernaia Theater, which four days later is to
present three dramatic pieces. The drawing is by Lucien Salmont.</p>

<p class="smcap">The British Lion's Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger.</p>
</div>

<p>One final echo of the struggle in the Crimea is found in another of
Tenniel's graphic animal pictures, "The British <span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>(p. 139)</span> Lion Smells a
Rat," which depicts an angry lion sniffing suspiciously at the crack
of a door, behind which is being held the conference which followed
the fall of Sebastopol. But by far the most famous instance of
Tenniel's work is his series of Cawnpore cartoons, the series bearing
upon the Indian mutiny of 1857; and one of the finest, if not the very
finest, of them all is that entitled "The British Lion's Vengeance on
the Bengal Tiger." It represents in the life work of Tenniel what
"General Février Turned Traitor" stands for in the life work of John
Leech. The subject was suggested to Tenniel by Shirley Brooks. It
summed up all the horror and thirst for revenge which animated England
when the news came of the treacherous atrocities of the Sepoy rebels.
The Cawnpore massacre of women and children ordered by the infamous
Nana Sahib had taken place in June, and when this cartoon appeared in
<i>Punch</i>, August 22, 1857, England had just sent thirty thousand troops
to India. In the picture the British lion is springing at the throat
of the Bengal tiger, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>(p. 140)</span> which is standing over the prostrate
bodies of a woman and a child. The tiger, fearful of being robbed of
its prey, is snarling at the avenging lion. Another of the famous
Cawnpore cartoons of Tenniel is descriptive of British vengeance on
the Sepoy mutineers. The English troops were simply wild for revenge
when the stories came to them of the atrocities which had been
perpetrated on English women and children, and their vengeance knew no
bounds. The Sepoys were blown from the mouths of the English cannon.
It was the custom of the English soldiers to pile up a heap of Sepoys,
dead or wounded, pour oil over them, and then set fire to the pile.
The Tenniel cartoon, entitled "Justice," published September 12, 1857,
shows the figure of Justice with sword and shield cutting down the
mutineers, while behind her are the British troops working destruction
with their bayonets.</p>

<p>No sooner had the English-French alliance against Russia come to an
end than <i>Punch</i> once more began to give expression to his disapproval
of Napoleon. A hostile spirit toward Frenchmen was ingrained in the
very nature of John Leech, and he vented it freely in such cartoons as
his celebrated "Cock-a-doodle-doo!" in which the French cock, clad in
the uniform of a colonel, is crowing lustily over the results of a war
of which Great Britain had borne the brunt. Or again, in "Some Foreign
Produce that Mr. Bull can very well Spare," a cut which includes
French conspirators, vile Frenchwomen, organ-grinders (Mr. Leech was
abnormally sensitive to street noises), and other objectionable
foreign refuse. It is interesting in this connection to note that
Leech's hostility to Louis Napoleon was the direct cause of
Thackeray's resignation from the staff of <i>Punch</i> in the winter of
1854. In the letter written in the following March, Thackeray
explains <span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>(p. 141)</span> that he had had some serious differences regarding
the editorial policy of <i>Punch</i>, and more specifically about the abuse
of Louis Napoleon which, he says, "I think and thought was writing
unjustly at that time, and dangerously for the welfare and peace of
the country:" and he then adds the specific instance which prompted
him to sever his connections: "Coming from Edinburgh, I bought a
<i>Punch</i> containing a picture of a beggar on horseback, in which the
emperor was represented galloping to hell with a sword reeking with
blood. As soon as ever I could, after my return, I went to Bouverie
Street and gave in my resignation." Thackeray's act had no influence
upon the policy of <i>Punch</i>. Leech's cartoons grew steadily more
incisive in character. One of the most extraordinary is that known as
"The French Porcupine." It represents Napoleon III. as a porcupine,
bristling with French bayonets in place of quills. One of Napoleon's
favorite sayings was "<i>L'Empire c'est la paix.</i>" But this saying was
very often contradicted by events, and the first ten years of his
occupation of the French throne showed France embroiled in the Crimean
War and the war with Austria. In preparation for the latter conflict
a large increase was being made in the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>(p. 142)</span> French military
armament; and Leech seized upon the emperor's dictum only to express
his skepticism. The cartoon appeared in March, 1859. As a matter of
fact, the idea in this cartoon had previously been used in another
called "The Puppet Show," published in June, 1854, depicting the Czar
Nicholas in a manner closely similar; yet Mr. Spielmann, who notes
this fact, adds that Mr. Leech had probably never seen, or else had
forgotten, the earlier caricature. This "French Porcupine" is cited as
an instance of Leech's extraordinary speed in executing a cartoon
directly upon the wooden block. The regular <i>Punch</i> dinner had that
week been held a day late. "Every moment was precious, and Leech
proposed the idea for the cartoon, drew it in two hours, and caught
his midday train on the following day, speeding away into the country
with John Tenniel for their usual Saturday hunt." It was during this
same year, 1859, at the close of the war which humbled Austria and
forced her to surrender Venetia to Sardinia, that Leech voiced the
suspicion that Louis was casting longing eyes upon Italian territory
in a cartoon entitled "A Scene from the New Pantomime." Napoleon III,
here figures as a clown, a revolver in his hand, a goose labeled Italy
protruding from his capacious pocket. He is earnestly assuring
Britannia, represented as a stout, elderly woman, eyeing him
suspiciously, that his intentions are strictly honorable.</p>

<p>In this country the political cartoon, which practically began with
William Charles's parodies upon Gillray, developed in a fitful and
spasmodic fashion until about the middle of the century. Their basis
was the Gillray group of many figures, and they had also much of the
Gillray coarseness and indecency, with a minimum of artistic skill.
They were mostly lithographs of the crudest sort, designed to pass
from hand to hand, or to be tacked up on the wall. It was not until
the first administration of Andrew Jackson that a school of distinctly
American political caricature can be said to have existed. It was in
1848 that the firm of Currier &amp; Ives, with an office in Nassau Street,
in New York City, began the publication of a series of campaign
caricatures of sufficient merit to have been a serious factor in
influencing public opinion. Crude as they are, these lithographs are
exceedingly interesting to study in detail. They tell their story very
plainly, even apart from the legends inclosed in the huge balloon-like
loops issuing from the lips of each member of the group&mdash;loops that
suggest a grotesque resemblance to a soap-bubble party on a large
scale. There is an amusing stiffness about the figures. They
stand in such painfully precise attitudes that at a little
distance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>(p. 149)</span> they might readily be mistaken for some antiquated
fashion plates. The faces, however, are in most cases excellent
likenesses; they are neither distorted nor exaggerated. The artists,
while sadly behind the times in retaining the use of the loop which
Continental cartoonists discarded much earlier, were in other respects
quite up-to-date, especially in adopting the method of the elder
Doyle, whose great contribution to caricature was that of drawing
absolutely faithful likenesses of the statesmen he wished to ridicule,
relying for the humor of the cartoon upon the situation in which he
placed them. It was only natural that the events of the Mexican War
should have inspired a number of cartoons. One of these is entitled
"Uncle Sam's Taylorifics," and shows a complacent Yankee coolly
snipping a Mexican in two with a huge pair of shears. One blade bears
the inscription "Volunteers," and the other "General Taylor." The
Yankee's left arm is labeled "Eastern States," the tail of his coat
"Oregon," his belt "Union," his left leg "Western States," and his
right leg, which he is using vigorously on the Mexican, "Southern
States," and the boot "Texas." Below the discomfited Mexican yawns the
Rio Grande. Behind the Yankee's back John Bull&mdash;a John Bull of the
type introduced by William Charles during the War of 1812&mdash;is looking
on enviously.</p>

<p>American national feeling on the subject of the European Powers
deriving benefit from the discovery of gold in California is
illustrated by a cartoon which shows the United States ready to defend
her possessions by force of arms. The various Powers have crossed the
sea and are very near to our coast. Queen Victoria, mounted on a bull,
is in the lead. She is saying: "Oh, dear Albert, don't you cry for me.
I'm off for California with my shovel on my knee." Behind <span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>(p. 152)</span>
her is the figure of Russia, saying: "As something is Bruin, I'll put
in my paw, while the nations around me are making a Jaw." Louis
Napoleon, who at the time had just been elected President of the
French, is drawn in the form of a bird. He is flying over the heads of
Victoria and Russia, and singing: "As you have gold for all creation,
den please give some to La Grand Nation. I have just become de
President, and back I shall not like to went." In the distance may be
seen Spain, and beyond the United States fleet. Along the shore
stretch the tents of an American army. Ominously coiled up on the
rocks is the American rattlesnake with the head of President Taylor.
Back of the camp is a battery of American guns directed by the
American eagle, which wears the head of General Scott, saying:
"Retreat, you poor d&mdash;&mdash;s! Nor a squabble engender, for our Gold unto
you we will never surrender. Right about face! Double quick to the
rear! And back to your keepers all hands of you steer."</p>

<p>The Presidential election of 1852 was cartooned under the title "Great
Foot Race for the Presidential Purse ($100,000 and Pickings) Over the
Union Course, 1852." The Whigs, encouraged by their success with
General Taylor, put forth another military officer, General Scott, as
their candidate, but in this cartoon Daniel Webster is shown to be
well in the lead and receiving the plaudits of most of the spectators.
Behind him is Scott, and a little way back is Franklin Pierce, who
proved the ultimate winner. "I can beat you both, and walk in at that,
although you had a hundred yards the start of me," is Webster's
conviction. "Confound Webster!" cries Scott. "What does he want to get
right in my way for? If he don't give out, or Pierce don't faint, I
shall be beaten." "No, no, old Fuss and Feathers," retorts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>(p. 156)</span> Pierce, "you don't catch this child fainting now. I am going
to make good time! Whether I win or not, Legs, do your duty."</p>

<p>Caricature dealing with the Presidential campaign of 1856 is
represented by the cartoon called "The Presidential Campaign of '56."
Buchanan, who proved the successful candidate, is mounted on a hideous
monster resembling a snake, and marked "Slavery." The monster is being
wheeled along on a low, flat car drawn by Pierce, Douglas, and Cass. A
star bearing the word "Kansas" is about to disappear down the
monster's throat. In the distance Fremont, on horseback, is calling
out: "Hold on! Take that animal back! We don't want it this side of
the fence." Buchanan is saying, "Pull down that fence and make way for
the Peculiar Institution." The fence in question is the Mason and
Dixon's line. The faces of Cass, Douglas, and Pierce, who are drawing
along the monster, are obliterated&mdash;they are absolutely formless.</p>

<p>The evils of slavery from a Northern point of view are shown in a
cartoon called "No Higher Law." King Slavery is seated on his throne
holding aloft a lash and a chain. Under his left elbow is the Fugitive
Slave Bill, resting on three human skulls. Daniel Webster stands
beside the throne, holding in his hand the scroll on which is printed,
"I propose to support that bill to the fullest extent&mdash;to the fullest
extent." A runaway slave is fighting off the bloodhounds that are
worrying him, and in the distance, on a hill, the figure of Liberty is
toppling from her pedestal.</p>

<p>The cartoon "Practical Illustration of the Fugitive Slave Law" sums up
very completely Abolitionist sentiment on the subject. The
slaveholder, with a noose in one hand and a chain in the other, a
cigar in his mouth and his top-hat <span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>(p. 158)</span> decorated with the single
star, which was the sign of the Southern Confederacy, is astride of
the back of Daniel Webster, who is crawling on all-fours. In Webster's
left hand is the Constitution. "Don't back out, Webster," says the
slaveholder. "If you do, we're ruined." The slave-woman who is being
pursued has taken refuge with William Lloyd Garrison, of the Boston
<i>Liberator</i>, who is saying: "Don't be alarmed, Susanna, you're safe
enough." One of Garrison's arms is encircling the negress's waist, at
the end of the other is a pistol. In the back of the picture is the
Temple of Liberty, over which two flags are flying. On one flag we
read: "All men are born free and equal;" on the other, "A day, an
hour, of virtuous Liberty is worth an Age of servitude."</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>(p. 159)</span> CHAPTER XVII<br>
<span class="smaller">NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES</span></h3>

<p>Down to the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the history of
American political caricature is a history of lost opportunities.
Revolution and war have always been the great harvest times of the
cartoonist. Gillray and Rowlandson owe their fame to the Napoleonic
wars; Philipon and Daumier, to the overthrow of Louis Philippe; Leech
and Tenniel reached their zenith in the days of the Crimean War and
the Sepoy Mutiny. It is not the election cartoon, or the tariff
cartoon, or the cartoon of local politics, it is the war cartoon that
is most widely hailed and longest remembered. Yet of all the wars in
which the United States has been engaged, not one has given birth to a
great satiric genius, and none but the latest, our recent war with
Spain, has received comprehensive treatment in the form of caricature.
It is not strange that the Revolutionary War and that of 1812 failed
to inspire any worthier efforts than William Charles's crude
imitations of Gillray. The mechanical processes of printing and
engraving, the methods of distribution, the standards of public taste,
were all still too primitive. The Mexican War was commemorated in a
number of the popular lithographs of the day; but it was not a
prolonged struggle, nor one calculated to stir the public mind
profoundly. With the Civil War the case was radically different. Here
was a struggle which threatened not only national honor, but national
existence&mdash;a struggle which prolonged itself grimly, month after
month, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>(p. 160)</span> and was borne home to a great majority of American
families with the force of personal tragedy, arraying friend against
friend, and father against son, and offering no brighter hope for the
future than the vista of a steadily lengthening death-roll. There was
never a time in the history of the nation when the public mind, from
one end of the country to the other, was in such a state of tension;
never, since the days of Napoleon, had there been such an opportunity
for a real master of satiric art. It seems amazing, as one looks back
over the pictorial records of these four years, that the magnitude of
the events did not galvanize into activity some unknown genius of the
pencil, and found then and there a new school of American caricature
commensurate with the fever-heat of public sentiment. The existing
school of caricature seems to have been absurdly inadequate. The
prevailing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161"></a>(p. 161)</span> types were a sort of fashion-plate
lithograph&mdash;groups of public men in mildly humorous situations, their
features fixed in the solemn repose of the daguerreotypes upon which
they were probably modeled; or else the conventional election
steeplechase, in which the contestants, with long, balloon-like loops
trailing from their mouths, suggest an absurd semblance to the cowboys
of a Wild West show, all engaged in a vain attempt to lasso and pull
in their own idle words. Many of the cartoons actually issued at the
outbreak of the Civil War impress one with a sense of indecorum, of
ill-timed levity. What was wanted was not the ineptitude of feeble
humor, but the rancor and venom of a Gillray, the stinging irony of a
Daumier, the grim dignity of a Tenniel. And it was not forthcoming.
The one living American who might have produced work of a high order
was Thomas Nast; but although Nast's pencil was dedicated to the cause
of the Union from the beginning to the end, in the series of powerful
emblematic pictures that appeared in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, his work as a
caricaturist did not begin until the close of the war.</p>

<p>It is interesting to conjecture what the great masters of caricature
would have made of such an opportunity. The issues of the war were so
clear-cut, their ethical significance so momentous, that an American
Gillray, a Unionist Gillray, would have found material for a series of
cartoons of eloquent and grewsome power. It is easy to imagine what
form they would have taken: an Uncle Sam, writhing in agony, his limbs
shackled with the chains of slavery, his lips gagged with the Fugitive
Slave Law, slowly being sawn asunder, while Abolition and Secession
guide the opposite ends of the saw, or else the American Eagle being
worried and torn limb from limb by Southern bloodhounds and stung
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>(p. 163)</span> by copperheads, while the British Lion and the rest of the
European menagerie look on, wistfully licking their chops and with
difficulty restraining themselves from participating in the feast.
Such a cartoonist would have found a mine of suggestion in "Uncle
Tom's Cabin"; he would have crowded his plates with Legrees and
Topsies, Uncle Toms and Sambos and Quimbos, fearful and wonderful to
look upon, brutal, distorted, and unforgettable.</p>

<p>It is equally easy to imagine what a Daumier might have done with the
material afforded by the Civil War. Some types of faces seem to defy
the best efforts of the caricaturist&mdash;smooth, regular-featured faces,
like that of Lord Rosebery, over which the pencil of satire seems to
slip without leaving any effective mark. Other faces, strong, rugged,
salient, seem to invite the caricaturist's efforts; and these were the
types that predominated among the leaders of the struggle for the
Union. Daumier's genius lay in his ability to caricature the human
face, to seize upon a minimum of lines and points, to catch some
absurd semblance to an inanimate object, some symbolic suggestion. And
when once found, he would harp upon it, ringing all possible changes,
keeping it insistently, mercilessly before the public. One can fancy
with what avidity he would have seized upon the stolid, indomitable
figure of Grant, intrenched behind his big, black, ubiquitous cigar.
That cigar would have become the center of interest, the portentous
symbol of Grant's dogged, taciturn persistence. Gradually that cigar
would have grown and grown, its thickening smoke spreading in a dense
war cloud over the whole series of cartoons, until finally it became
the black, shining muzzle of a cannon, belching forth the powder and
fire and ammunition that was to decide the issue of the war. What
Tenniel would have done is evidenced by what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>(p. 165)</span> he actually did
in <i>Punch</i>. The great tragedies of those four years, Gettysburg and
Bull Run and the Battle of the Wilderness, would have been pictured
with the tragic dignity that stamps his famous cartoon in which he
commemorated the assassination of Lincoln.</p>

<p>In view of what might have been done, it is somewhat exasperating to
look over the actual cartoons of the war as they have come down to us.
Even when a clever idea was evolved none seemed to have the cleverness
or the enterprise to develop it. As all the modern cartoonists
realize, nothing is more effective than a well-planned series. It is
like the constant dropping that wears away the stone. The most potent
pictorial satire has always been the gradual elaboration of some
clever idea&mdash;the periodic reappearance of the same characters in
slightly modified environment, like the successive chapters of a
serial story. The public learn to look forward to them, and hail each
reappearance with a renewed burst of enthusiasm. The cartoonists of
the Civil War do not seem to have grasped this idea. A single example
will serve as an illustration. A clever cartoon, entitled "Virginia
Pausing," appeared just at the time that Virginia, the last of the
States to secede, joined the Confederacy. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167"></a>(p. 167)</span> The several
Southern States, represented as young rats, are gayly scampering off,
in the order in which they seceded, South Carolina heading the
procession. Virginia straggling in the rear finds herself under the
paw of "Uncle Abe," represented as a watchful and alert old mouser,
and has paused, despite herself, to consider her next step. The Union,
personified as the mother rat of the brood, lies stark and stiff on
her back, with the Stars and Stripes waving over her corpse, and
underneath, the legend, "The Union must and shall be preserved." Now
this idea of the Southern States as a brood of "Secession rats" was
capable of infinite elaboration. It might have been carried on
throughout the entire four years of the struggle, the procession
preserving the same significant order, with South Carolina in the
lead, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>(p. 168)</span> Virginia bringing up the rear, and Lincoln, as a wise
and resourceful mouser, ever in pursuit. It could have shown the rats
at bay, cornered, entrapped&mdash;in short, the whole history of the war in
a form of genial allegory. But if the initial cartoon, "Virginia
Pausing," ever had a sequel, it perished in the general wreckage of
the Confederacy.</p>

<p>The welcome which awaited caricature, even of the crudest sort, at the
outbreak of the war is illustrated by the curious vogue enjoyed by
envelopes adorned with all sorts of patriotic and symbolic devices&mdash;an
isolated tombstone inscribed "Jeff Davis alone," a Confederate Mule,
blanketed with the Stars and Bars&mdash;a slave-owner vainly brandishing
his whip and shouting to a runaway slave, "Come back here, you black
rascal." The latter, safe within the shadow of Fortress Monroe,
defiantly places his thumb to his nose, and in allusion to General
Butler's famous decision, retorts: "Can't come back, nohow, massa. Dis
chile's CONTRABAN'."</p>

<p>It is not surprising to find that Lincoln throughout the struggle was
a favorite subject for the caricaturist. His tall, ungainly,
loose-knit figure, his homely features, full of noble resolve, seemed
to offer a standing challenge to the cartoonist, who usually treated
him with indulgent kindness. The exceptions are all the more
conspicuous. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>(p. 169)</span> A case in point is the cartoon commemorating
Lincoln's first call for volunteers for three months&mdash;a period then
supposed to be ample for crushing out the rebellion. The artist has
represented Lincoln as the image of imbecilic dismay, while a Union
soldier with a sternly questioning gaze relentlessly presents to him a
promissory note indorsed, "I promise to subdue the South in 90 days.
Abe Lincoln." A much more typical and kindly cartoon of Lincoln is the
one representing him as emulating the feat of Blondin and crossing the
rapids of Niagara on a tight-rope, bearing the negro problem on his
shoulders, and sustaining his equipoise with the aid of a balancing
pole labeled "Constitution."</p>

<p>The really clever cartoons of this period are so few in number, and
stand out so prominently from a mass of second-rate material, that
there is real danger of attaching undue <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170"></a>(p. 170)</span> importance to them.
Such a plate as "The Southern Confederacy a Fact! Acknowledged by a
Mighty Prince and Faithful Ally," which was issued by a Philadelphia
publisher in 1861, although crudely drawn, is one of the very few that
show the influence of the early English school. It represents the
Devil and his assembled Cabinet in solemn conclave, receiving the
envoys of the Southern Confederacy. The latter includes, among others,
Jeff Davis, General Beauregard, and a personification of "Mr. Mob Law,
Chief Justice." They are bearers of credentials setting forth the
fundamental principles of the government, as "Treason, Rebellion,
Murder, Robbery, Incendiarism, Theft, etc." Satan, interested in spite
of himself, is murmuring to his companions, "I am afraid in Rascality
they will beat us."</p>

<p>An effective allegorical cartoon, which appeared at a time <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>(p. 171)</span>
when the cause of the Union seemed almost hopeless, pictures Justice
on the rock of the Constitution dressed in the Stars and Stripes and
waving an American flag toward a happier scene, where the sun of
Universal Freedom is brightly shining. Behind her are hideous scenes
of disorder and national disaster. A loathsome serpent, of which the
head is called "Peace Compromise," the body, "Mason and Dixon's Line,"
and the tail "Copperhead," is crawling up the rock seeking to destroy
her. In one of its coils it is crushing out the lives of a number of
black women and children. In one corner of the cartoon the figure of a
winged Satan is hovering gleefully over a mob which is hanging a negro
to a lamp-post&mdash;an allusion to the Draft Riots in New York. Some of
the mob are bearing banners with the words "Black Men have no
Rights." In the shadowy background of the picture <span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>(p. 172)</span> a
slaveholder is lashing his slave, tied to a post, with a whip called
"Lawful Stimulant." An unctuous capitalist is talking with a group of
Secessionists, seated on a rock called "State Rights." In contrast
with the dark picture on which Justice has turned her back is the
bright vista of the future, "The Union as it will be," into which she
is looking. There we see a broad river and a prosperous city. A
negress, free and happy, is sewing by her cabin door, her child
reading a book upon her knee.</p>

<p>Many of the best cartoons of the period revolve around the rivalry
between General McClellan and General Grant, and the incidents of the
McClellan-Lincoln campaign of 1864. "The Old Bull-dog on the Right
Track" is one of the best products of the war cartoonists. It
represents Grant as a thoroughbred bulldog, seated in dogged tenacity
of purpose on the "Weldon Railroad," and preparing to fight it out on
that line, if it takes all summer. At the end of the line is a kennel,
labeled "Richmond," and occupied by a pack of lean, cowardly hounds,
Lee, Davis, and Beauregard among the number, who are yelping: "You
aint got the kennel yet, old fellow!" A bellicose little dwarf,
McClellan, is advising the bulldog's master: "Uncle Abraham, don't you
think you had better call the old dog off now? I'm afraid he'll hurt
these other dogs, if he catches hold of them!" To which President
Lincoln serenely rejoins: "Why, little Mac, that's the same pack of
curs that chased you aboard of the gunboat two years <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>(p. 177)</span> ago.
They are pretty nearly used up now, and I think it's best to go in and
finish them."</p>

<p>The conservative policy which marked the military career of General
McClellan and his candidacy for the Presidency in 1864 is ridiculed in
a cartoon entitled "Little Mac, in His Great Two-Horse Act, in the
Presidential Canvass of 1864." Here McClellan is pictured as a circus
rider about to come to grief, owing to the unwillingness of his two
steeds to pull together in harmony. A fiery and stalwart horse
represents "war"; while peace is depicted as a worthless and
broken-down hack. Little Mac is saying, "Curse them balky horses&mdash;I
can't manage the Act nohow. One threw me in Virginia, and the other is
bound the wrong way." In the background is the figure of Lincoln
attired as a clown. "You tried to ride them two horses on the
Peninsula for two years, Mac," he calls out, "but it wouldn't work."</p>

<p>Another striking cartoon of this Presidential campaign depicts the
Republican leaders burying the War Democracy. The cartoon is called
"The Grave of the Union," and was drawn by Zeke. The hearse is being
driven by Secretary Stanton, who commenced, "My jackasses had a load,
but they pulled it through bravely." In harness and attached to the
bodies of jackasses are the heads of Cochrane, Butler, Meagher, and
Dickinson. At the head of the grave, a sort of master of ceremonies,
is the familiar figure of Horace Greeley, saying, "I guess we'll bury
it so deep that it will never get up again." By his side is Lincoln,
who is inquiring, "Chase, will it stay down?" to which Chase replies,
"My God, it must stay down, or we shall go up." The funeral service is
being conducted by Henry Ward Beecher, who is carrying a little negro
in his arms. "Not thy will, O Lord, but mine be done." Beecher is
reading from the book before <span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179"></a>(p. 179)</span> him. The coffins about to be
lowered into the grave are marked respectively "Free Speech and Free
Press," "Habeas Corpus," and "Union."</p>

<p>One of the most striking caricatures suggested by the contest between
Lincoln and McClellan for the Presidency of 1864 is entitled "The
Abolition Catastrophe; or, the November Smash-up." It is really
nothing more than the old hackneyed idea of the "Presidential
Steeplechase" presented in a new guise. The artist, however, proved
himself to be a false prophet. It shows a race to the White House
between two trains, in which the one on which Lincoln is serving as
engineer has just come to destruction on the rocks of "Emancipation,"
"Confiscation," and "$400,000,000,000 Public Debt." The train in the
charge of General McClellan, its locomotive flying the flag
"Constitution," is running along smoothly and rapidly and is just
turning the curve leading up to the door of the White House.
McClellan, watching from his cab the discomfiture of his foe, calls
derisively, "Wouldn't you like to swap horses now, Lincoln?" In the
coaches behind are the elated passengers of the Democratic train. In
striking contrast is the plight in which the Republican Party is
shown. Lincoln, thrown up in the air by the shock of the collision,
calls back to his rival, "Don't mention it, Mac, this reminds me of
a"&mdash;an allusion to the President's fondness for illustrating every
argument with a story. From the debris of the wreck of the locomotive
peer out the faces of the firemen&mdash;two very black negroes. One is
calling, "War's de rest ob dis ole darky? Dis wot yer call
'mancipation?" And the other, "Lor' A'mighty! Massa Lincum, is dis wot
yer call Elewating de Nigger?" The passengers behind are in an equally
unhappy strait. Secretary Stanton, pinned under the wheels of the
first coach, is crying, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180"></a>(p. 180)</span> "Oh, dear! If I could telegraph this
to Dix I'd make it out a victory." Among the passengers may be
recognized the countenances of Beecher, Butler, and Seward, while
blown up in the air is Horace Greeley, calling out to Lincoln that the
disaster only verifies the prediction which had been printed in the
<i>Tribune</i>. Popular discontent at the unreliability of news of the war
found utterance in a skit representing Lincoln as a bartender occupied
in concocting a mixed drink, called "New York Press," which he is
dexterously pouring back and forth between two tumblers, labeled
respectively "Victory" and "Defeat." The ingredients are taken from
bottles of "Bunkum," "Bosh," "Brag," and "Soft Sawder."</p>

blacks. At one end of the picture Mr. Lincoln is receiving with great
warmth and cordiality Miss Dinah Arabella Aramintha Squash, a negress
of unprepossessing appearance, who has as her escort Henry Ward
Beecher. At a table nearby Horace Greeley is treating another
gorgeously attired negress to ice cream. Two repulsive looking negroes
are making violent love to two white women. A passing carriage in
charge of a white coachman and two white footmen contains a negro
family. In the background, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184"></a>(p. 184)</span> Englishmen, Frenchmen, and others

<p>The attempt at escape, the apprehension and the incarceration of the
President of the Confederacy are illustrated in a long series of

Davis at Irwinsville by General Wilson's cavalry. Davis, attired in
feminine dress, is climbing over a fence in order to escape his
pursuers. He has dropped his handbag, but he still holds his
unsheathed knife. "I thought your government was too magnanimous to
hunt down women and children," he calls out to the Union soldiers, one
of whom has caught him by the skirts and is trying to drag him back.
Mrs. Davis, by her <span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>(p. 185)</span> husband's side, is entreating, "Don't

is a noose connecting with a huge gallows and the rope is about to be
drawn taut, while from an organ below the cage a musician is grinding
out the strain, "Yankee Doodle." In the shape of birds perched on
little gallows of their own above the President's cage, each with a
noose around his neck, are the figures of the other leaders of the
Confederacy. A crow is pecking at a grinning skull under which is
written "Booth." <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186"></a>(p. 186)</span> To this skull Uncle Sam is playfully

his vote for McClellan. A thick-lipped negro stands guard over the

soldier's decorated breast. "Hallo, dar!" he calls out threateningly,
"you can't put in dat, you copper-head traitor, nor any odder, 'cept

Alas, my country!" A corrupt election clerk is regarding the scene
with disquiet. "I'm afraid we shall have trouble if that soldier is
not allowed to vote," he says. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>(p. 187)</span> To which a companion cynically

NATIONS AND MEN IN CARICATURE</h3>

<p>In looking over the historical and political caricature of the
nineteenth century, one very naturally finds several different methods
of treatment and subdivision suggesting themselves. First, there is
the obvious method of chronological order, which is being followed in
the present volume, and which commended itself as being at once the
simplest and the most comprehensive. It is the one method by which the
history of the century may be regarded as the annals of a family of
nations&mdash;a grotesque family of ill-assorted quadrupeds and still more
curious bipeds, stepping forth two by two from the pages of comic art
as from the threshold of some modern Noah's ark&mdash;Britannia and the
British lion, Columbia and Uncle Sam, India and the Bengal tiger,
French Liberty and the imperial eagle. It is the one method which
focuses the attention upon the inter-relation, the significant
groupings of these symbolic figures, and disregards their individual
and isolated actions. What the Russian bear, the British lion, are
doing in the seclusion of their respective fastnesses is of vastly
less interest than the spectacle of the entire royal menagerie of
Europe uniting in an effort to hold Napoleon at bay. In other words,
this method enables us to pass lightly over questions of purely
national interest and home policy&mdash;the Corn Laws of England, the
tariff issues in the United States&mdash;and to keep the eye centered upon
the really big dramas of history, played upon an international stage.
It subordinates caricature itself to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189"></a>(p. 189)</span> the sequence of great
events and great personages. It is the Emperor Napoleon, his reign and
his wars, and not the English caricaturist Gillray; it is Louis
Philippe, the bourgeois king, and not Philipon and Daumier, who form
the center of interest. In other words, from the present point of
view, the caricature itself is not so much the object looked at as it
is a powerful and clairvoyant lens through which we may behold past
history in the curiously distorted form in which it was mirrored back
by contemporary public opinion.</p>

<p>Other methods, however, might be used effectively, each offering some
special advantage of its own. For instance, the whole history of the
nineteenth century might be divided, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190"></a>(p. 190)</span> so to speak,
geographically. The separate history of each nation might have been
followed down in turn&mdash;the changing fortunes of England, typified by
John Bull; of Russia in the guise of the bear; of the United States
under the forms of the swarthy, smooth-faced Jonathan of early days,
and the pleasanter Uncle Sam of recent years; and of France, typified
at different times as an eagle, as a Gallic cock, as an angry goddess,
and as a plump, pleasant-faced woman in a tricolored petticoat. Again,
if it were desirable to emphasize the development of comic art rather
than its influence in history, one might group the separate divisions
of the subject around certain schools of caricature, dealing first
with Gillray, Rowlandson, and their fellows among the allied
Continental <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191"></a>(p. 191)</span> nations; passing thence to the caricaturists of
1830, and thence carrying the sequence through Leech, Cham, Tenniel,
Nast, down to the caricaturists who in the closing years of the
century developed the scope of caricature to a hitherto unparalleled
extent. Still again, the history of the century in caricature might be
traced along from some peculiarity, greatly exaggerated, of some great
man to another personal peculiarity of some other great man: leaping
from the tri-cornered hat of the Emperor Napoleon to the great nose of
the Iron Duke, then on to the toupet and pear-shaped countenance of
Louis Philippe, the emaciation of Abraham Lincoln, the grandpa's hat
of the Harrison administration, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>(p. 192)</span> the forehead curl of
Disraeli, the collar of Gladstone, the turned-up moustaches of the
Emperor William, and the prominent teeth of Mr. Roosevelt. This
feature of the caricature seems important enough to justify a brief
digression. It forms one of the foundation stones of the art, second
only in importance to the conventionalized symbols of the different
nations. From the latter the cartoonist builds up the century's
history as recorded in its great events. From the former he traces
that history as recorded in the personality of its great men.</p>

<p>The cartoons in which these different peculiarities of personal
appearance are emphasized cover the whole range of caricature, and the
whole gamut of public opinion which inspired it. Here we may find
every degree of malice, from <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>(p. 193)</span> the fierce goggle eyes and
diabolical expression which Gillray introduced into his portraits of
the hated Bonaparte down to the harmless exaggeration of the collar
points by which Furniss good-naturedly satirized the appearance of Mr.
Gladstone. Again, in this respect caricature varies much, because all
the great men of the century did not offer to the caricaturists the
same opportunities in the matter of unusual features or personal
eccentricities.</p>

<p class="smcap">The First Conscript of France.</p>
</div>

<p>The authentic portraits and contemporary descriptions of the first
Napoleon show us that he was a man whose appearance was marred by no
particular eccentricity of feature, and that the cartoons of which he
is the principal subject are largely allegorical, or inspired by the
artist's intensity of hatred. One German caricaturist, by a subtle
distortion and a lengthening of the cheeks and chin, introduced a
resemblance <span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194"></a>(p. 194)</span> to a rapacious wolf while preserving something of
the real likeness. But in the goggle-eyed monsters of Gillray there is
nothing save the hat and the uniform which suggests the real Napoleon.
It was a sort of incarnation of Beelzebub which Gillray wished to draw
and did draw, a monstrosity designed to rouse the superstitious hatred
of the ignorant and lower classes of England, and to excite the nation
to a warlike frenzy. The caricature aimed at Bonaparte's great rival,
the conqueror of Waterloo, was produced in more peaceful times, was
the work of his own countryman, was based mainly on party differences,
and, naturally enough, it was in the main good-natured and kindly.
Wellington in caricature may be summed up by saying that it was all
simply an exaggeration of the size of his nose. The <i>poire</i> drawn into
resemblance of the countenance of Louis Philippe was originally
innocent enough, and had it been entirely ignored by the monarch and
his ministers, would probably have had no political effect, and in the
course of a few years been entirely forgotten. But being taken
seriously and characterized as seditious, it acquired an exaggerated
significance which may almost be said to have led to the revolution of
1848 and the establishment of the Second Republic. From the rich
material offered by our War of Secession the caricaturists drew little
more than the long, gaunt figure and the scraggy beard of Lincoln, and
the cigar of General Grant. The possibilities of this cigar, as they
probably would have been brought out by an artist like Daumier, have
been suggested in an earlier chapter. It was the goatee of Louis
Napoleon that was exaggerated to give a point to most of the cartoons
in which he was a figure, although during the days of his power there
were countless caricatures which drew suggestions from the
misadventures of his early life, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>(p. 195)</span> his alleged experiences as a
waiter in New York and a policeman in London, his escape from prison
in the clothes of the workman Badinguet (a name which his political
enemies applied to him very freely), and the fiasco at Strasburg. No
men of their time were more freely caricatured than Disraeli in
England and Thiers in France, for no men offered more to the
caricaturist, Disraeli being at once a Jew and the most exquisite of
affected dandies, and Thiers being, with the exception of Louis Blanc,
the smallest man of note in France. In one cartoon in <i>Punch</i>,
Disraeli was figured as presiding over "Fagin's Political School." In
another he was represented as a hideous Oriental peri fluttering about
the gates of Paradise. Thiers's large head and diminutive stature are
subjects of countless cartoons, in which he is shown emerging from a
wineglass or concealed in a waistcoat <span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196"></a>(p. 196)</span> pocket, although
<i>Punch</i> once humorously depicted him as Gulliver bound down by the
Lilliputians.</p>

<p>If one were to attempt to draw a broad general distinction between
French and English caricature throughout the century, it would be
along the line of English superiority in the matter of satirizing
great events, French superiority in satirizing great men. The English
cartoonists triumphed in the art of crowded canvases and effective
groupings; the French in seizing upon the salient feature of face or
form, and by a grotesque distortion, a malicious quirk, fixing upon
their luckless subject a brand of ridicule that refused to be
forgotten. Although the fashion of embodying fairly recognizable
portraits of prominent statesmen in caricatures became general in
England early in the century, for a long time the effect was marred by
their lack of facial expression. From situations of all sorts, ranging
from high comedy to deadly peril and poignant suffering, the familiar
features of British statesmen look forth placid, unconcerned, with the
fixed, impersonal stare of puppets in a Punch-and-Judy show. No French
artist ever threw away his opportunities in such a foolish,
spendthrift manner. Even where the smooth, regular features of some
especially characterless face gave little or nothing for a satiric
pencil to seize upon, a Daumier or a Gill would manufacture a
ludicrous effect through the familiar device of a giant's head on a
dwarf's body, or the absurdly distorted reflection of a cylindrical
mirror. But by the time hostilities broke out between France and
Prussia facial caricature had become an important factor in the
British school of satire, as exemplified in the weekly pages of
<i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>By Tenniel in Punch.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This was very natural, because the history of these years was largely
a history of individuals. During the years between the close of the
Civil War and the outbreak of war between France and Prussia the three
dominant figures in European political caricature were the French
Emperor, Prince Bismarck, and Benjamin Disraeli. Since 1848, Louis
Napoleon had been the most widely caricatured man in Europe; and the
outcome of the War of 1866 had raised Bismarck, as the pilot of the
Prussian ship <span class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>(p. 198)</span> of state, to an importance second only to
Napoleon himself. The caricature of which Disraeli was the subject was
necessarily much narrower in its scope, and confined to a great extent
to England. It was not until the century's eighth decade that he
received full recognition at the hands of the Continental
caricaturists, and his prominence in the cartoons preceding the
Franco-Prussian War was due to the prestige of <i>Punch</i>, and to the
opportunity which his own peculiar personality and striking appearance
offered to the caricaturists. It was not long after the fall of
Richmond and the end of the war that the agitation over the claims of
the United States against England on account of the damage done by
the warship <i>Alabama</i>, a question which was not <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199" name="page199"></a>(p. 199)</span> settled until
a number of years later, began. The two powers for a time could not
agree on any scheme of arbitration, and the condition of affairs in
the autumn of 1865 was summed up by Tenniel in <i>Punch</i>, in a cartoon
entitled "The Disputed Account," in which the United States and
England are represented as two haggling women and Madame Britannia is
haughtily saying: "Claim for damages against me? Nonsense, Columbia!
Don't be mean over money matters." But England, as well as America,
had other matters besides the <i>Alabama</i> claims to disturb her and to
keep busy the pencils of her cartoonists. Besides purely political
issues at home, there were the Jamaica troubles and Fenianism: and the
French Emperor was very urgent that stronger extradition treaties
should be established between the two countries. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page200" name="page200"></a>(p. 200)</span> This last
issue was cleverly hit off by <i>Punch</i> in a cartoon which pictures
Britannia showing Napoleon the Third a portrait of himself as he
appeared in 1848 and saying: "That, Sire, is the portrait of a
gentleman whom I should have had to give up to the French Government
had I always translated 'extradition' as your Majesty's lawyers now
wish." The agitation over the Jamaica troubles died out, the
threatened Fenian invasion of Canada came to nothing, Louis Napoleon
withdrew the French troops from Mexico, and the eyes of Europe were
directed toward the war cloud hovering over Prussia and Austria. Early
in June, 1866, there was a cessation of diplomatic relations between
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>(p. 201)</span> two countries, followed immediately by a declaration of
war on the part of Prussia, whose armies straightway entered Saxony
and Hanover. The attitude of England and France toward the
belligerents was the subject of <i>Punch's</i> cartoon that week. It was
called "Honesty and Policy," and shows Britannia and Napoleon
discussing the situation, while in the background the Prussian King
and the Austrian Emperor are shaking their fists in each other's
faces. Britannia confides regretfully to Napoleon: "Well, I've done my
best. If they must smash each other, they must." And the French
Emperor says in a gleeful aside: "And someone may pick up the pieces!"
The same figure of speech is further developed in a later cartoon
which appeared in August, during the negotiations for peace. Napoleon
III., in the guise of a ragpicker, is being warned off the
Königstrasse by Bismarck: <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202" name="page202"></a>(p. 202)</span> "Pardon, mon ami, but we really
can't allow you to pick up anything here;" and "Nap. the Chiffonnier"
rejoins: "Pray, don't mention it, M'sieu! It's not of the slightest
consequence."</p>

<p>After the battle of Sadowa, Austria accepted readily the offer of the
French Emperor to bring about a suspension of hostilities, the Emperor
of Austria agreeing to cede Venetia, which was handed over to France,
as a preliminary to its cession to Italy. Tenniel pictured this event
in a cartoon showing Napoleon acting as the temporary keeper of the
Lion of St. Mark's. Bismarck was now becoming a conspicuous figure in
European politics, and his rivalry to Napoleon is shown in a <i>Punch</i>
cartoon entitled "Rival Arbiters," which appeared about this time.</p>

two immediately preceding the Franco-Prussian War was made the subject
of some excellent <i>Punch</i> cartoons. One of these, called "Easing the
Curb," appeared in July, 1869. The imperial rule was gradually
becoming unpopular, and the opposition gaining in strength and
boldness. The Emperor found it prudent to announce that it was his
intention to grant to the French Chamber a considerable extension of
power. In "Easing the Curb," <i>Punch</i> depicts France as a horse drawing
the imperial carriage. Within are the Empress and the Prince
Imperial, evidently greatly alarmed. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204"></a>(p. 204)</span> Napoleon is standing at
the horse's head, calling out: "Have no fear, my dears. I shall just
drop ze curb a leetel." In another cartoon a few months later,
Napoleon the Third is shown wearing the crown of King John, and
surrounded by a group of persistent barons, signing a magna charta for
France.</p>

<p>In the pages of <i>Punch</i> from July, 1870, until the spring of 1871, one
may follow very closely the history of the Franco-Prussian War and of
the Commune. The first of the cartoons on this subject, published just
before the declaration of war, is entitled "A Duel to the Death." In
it the King of Prussia and the French Emperor are shown as duellists,
sword in hand, while Britannia is endeavoring to act as mediator.
"Pray stand back, madam," says Napoleon. "You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205"></a>(p. 205)</span> mean well, but
this is an old family quarrel and we must fight it out." <i>Punch</i>
seemed to have an early premonition of what the result of the war
would be, for, before any decisive battle had been fought, it
published a striking cartoon entitled "A Vision on the Way,"
representing the shade of the great Napoleon confronting the Emperor
and his son on the warpath, and bidding them "Beware!" The departure
of the Prince Imperial to the front is made the subject of a very
pretty and pathetic cartoon called "Two Mothers." It shows the Empress
bidding farewell to her son, while France, as another weeping mother,
is saying: "Ah, madam, a sure happiness for <i>you</i>, sooner or later;
but there were dear sons of <i>mine</i> whom I shall never see again."</p>

<p>After the unimportant engagement at Saarbrück disaster began falling
thick and fast on the French arms, and soon we find <i>Punch</i> taking up
again the idea of the two monarchs as rival duelists. By this time the
duel has been decided. Louis Napoleon, sorely wounded and with broken
sword, is leaning against a tree. "You have fought gallantly, sir,"
says the King. "May I not hear you say you have had enough?" To which
the Emperor replies: <span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207"></a>(p. 207)</span> "I have been deceived about my strength.
I have no choice." With Sedan, the downfall of the Empire, and the
establishment of the Republic, France ceased to be typified under the
form of Louis Napoleon. Henceforth she became an angry, blazing-eyed
woman, calling upon her sons to rise and repel the advance of the
invader. The cartoon in <i>Punch</i> commemorating September 4, 1870, when
the Emperor was formally deposed and a Provisional Government of
National Defense established under the Presidency of General Trochu,
with Gambetta, Favre, and Jules Ferry among its leading members, shows
her standing erect by the side of a cannon, the imperial insignia
trampled beneath her feet, waving aloft the flag of the Republic, and
shouting from the "Marseillaise":</p>

removed to Versailles, and that the palace of Louis XIV. was to
shelter the Prussian King surrounded by his conquering armies, drew
from Tenniel the cartoon in which he showed the German monarch seated
at his table in the palace studying the map of Paris, while in the
background are the ghosts of Louis XIV. and the great Napoleon. The
ghost of the Grand Monarque is asking sadly: "Is this the end of 'all
the glories'?" The sufferings of Paris during the siege are summed up
in a cartoon entitled "Germany's Ally," in which the figure of Famine
is laying its cold, gaunt hand on the head of the unhappy woman
typifying the stricken city. The beginning of the bombardment was
commemorated in a cartoon entitled "Her Baptism of Fire," showing the
grim and bloody results of the falling of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209"></a>(p. 209)</span> first shells.
The whole tone of <i>Punch</i> after the downfall of the Emperor shows a
growing sympathy on the part of the English people toward France, and
the feeling in England that Germany, guided by the iron hand of
Bismarck, was exacting a cruel and unjust penalty entirely out of
proportion. This belief that the terms demanded by the Germans were
harsh and excessive is shown in the <i>Punch</i> cartoon "Excessive Bail,"
where justice, after listening to Bismarck's argument, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210"></a>(p. 210)</span> says
that she cannot "sanction a demand for exorbitant securities."</p>

<p>French caricature during "the terrible year" which saw Gravelotte,
Sedan, and the downfall of the Empire was necessarily somber and
utterly lacking in French gayety. It was not until the tragic days of
the Siege and the Commune that the former strict censorship of the
French press was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212"></a>(p. 212)</span> relaxed, and the floodgates were suddenly
opened for a veritable inundation of cartoons. M. Armand Dayot, in his
admirable pictorial history of this epoch, which has already been
frequently cited in the present volume, says in this connection: "It
has been said with infinite justice that when art <span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>(p. 213)</span> is absent
from caricature nothing remains but vulgarity." In proof of this, one
needs only to glance through the albums containing the countless
cartoons that appeared during the Siege, and more especially during
the Commune. Aside from those signed by Daumier, Cham, André Gill, and
a few other less famous artists, they are unclean compositions,
without design or wit, odious in color, the gross stupidity of their
legends rivaling their lamentable poverty of execution. But under the
leadership of Daumier, the small group of artists who infused their
genius into the weekly pages of <i>Charivari</i>, made these tragic months
one of the famous periods in the annals of French caricature. Of the
earlier generation, the irrepressible group whose mordant irony had
hastened the down fall of Louis Philippe, Daumier alone survived to
chronicle by his pencil the disasters which befell France, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>(p. 214)</span> a talent as great as he had possessed thirty-odd years
before, when engaged in his light-hearted and malicious campaign
against the august person of Louis Philippe. Then there were the
illustrious "Cham" (Comte de Noë), and André Gill (a caricaturist of
striking wit), Hadol, De Bertall, De Pilopel, Faustin, Draner, and a
number of others not so well known. But, above all, it was Daumier
who, after twenty years of the Empire, during which his pencil had
been politically idle, returned in his old age to the fray with all
the vigor of the best days of <i>La Caricature</i>.</p>

<p>Yet to those whose sympathies were with France during the struggle of
1870-71, there is a distinct pathos in the change that is seen in the
later work of Daumier&mdash;not a personal pathos, but a pathos due to the
changed condition of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>(p. 215)</span> country which it reflects. The old
dauntless audacity, the trenchant sarcasm, the mocking, light-hearted
laughter, is gone. In its place is the haunting bitterness of an old
man, under the burden of an impotent wrath&mdash;a man who, for all that he
dips his pencil in pure vitriol, cannot do justice to the nightmare
visions that beset him. There is no better commentary upon the
pervading feeling of helpless anger and outraged national pride of
this epoch than in these haunting designs of Daumier's. They are the
work of a man tremulous with feverish indignation, weird and ghastly
conceptions, such as might have emanated from the caldron of Macbeth's
witches. The backgrounds are filled in with solid black, like a
funeral pall; and from out the darkness the features of Bismarck, of
Von Moltke, of William I., leer malevolently, distorted into hideous,
ghoulish figures&mdash;vampires feasting upon <span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>(p. 216)</span> the ruin they have
wrought. French liberty, in the guise of a wan, emaciated, despairing
figure, the personification of a wronged and outraged womanhood,
haunts Daumier's pages. At one time she is standing, bound and gagged,
between the gaping muzzles of two cannon marked, respectively, "Paris,
1851," and "Sedan, 1870," and underneath the laconic legend, "Histoire
d'un Règne."</p>

<p>Another cartoon shows France as a female Prometheus bound to the rock,
her vitals being torn by the Germanic vulture. A number of these
cartoons, all of which appeared in <i>La Charivari</i>, treat bitterly of
the disastrous results of the twenty years during which Louis Napoleon
was the Emperor of the French. The sketch called "This Has Killed
That" has allusion to the popular ballot which elected the
Prince-President to the throne. A gaunt, angry female figure is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220"></a>(p. 220)</span> pointing with one hand to the ballot-box, in which repose
the "Ours" which made Louis Napoleon an Emperor, and with the other to
the corpses on the battlefield where the sun of his empire finally
sets. "This," she cries, "has killed that." The same idea suggested a
somewhat similar cartoon, in which a French peasant, gazing at the
shell-battered ruins of his humble home, exclaims in the peasant's
ungrammatical <i>patois</i>: "And it was for this that I voted 'Yes.'"
Still more grim and ominous is the cartoon showing a huge mouse-trap
with three holes. The mouse-trap represents the Plebiscite. Two of the
holes, marked respectively, "1851" and "1870," have been sprung, and
each has caught the throat of a victim. The third, however, still
yawns open warningly, with the date not completely filled in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>(p. 221)</span> Still another cartoon, thoroughly characteristic of Daumier's
later manner, is "The Dream of Bismarck," one which touches upon the
idea which has been used allegorically in connection with every great
conqueror whose wake is marked by the strewn corpses of fallen
thousands. In it Bismarck, frightfully haggard and ghastly of
countenance, is sleeping in his chair, while at his side is the grim
figure of Death bearing a huge sickle and pointing out over the bloody
battlefield.</p>

<p>Of the younger group of cartoonists none is more closely connected
with the events of the <i>année terrible</i> than "Cham," the Comte de Noë.
The name Noë, it will be remembered, is French for Noah, just as Cham
is the French equivalent of Ham, second son of the patriarch of
Scripture. The Comte de Noë was also second son of his father, hence
the appropriateness of his pseudonym. As a caricaturist, Cham was
animated by no such seriousness of purpose as formed the inspiration
of Daumier; and this was why he never became a really great
caricaturist. It was the humorous side of life, even of the tragedies
of life, that appealed to him, and he reflected it back with an
incisive drollery which was irresistible. He was one of the most rapid
and industrious of workers, and found in the events of <i>l'année
terrible</i> the inspiration of a vast number of cartoons. The looting
propensities of the Prussians were satirized in a sketch showing two
Prussian officers looking greedily at a clock on the mantelpiece in a
French château. "Let us take the clock." "But peace has already been
signed." "No matter. Don't you see the clock is slow?" The German
acquisition of the Rhenish provinces is summed up in a picture which
shows a German officer attaching to his leg a chain, at the end of
which is a huge ball marked Alsace. The siege having <span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>(p. 222)</span> turned
every Parisian into a nominal soldier, this condition of affairs is
hit off by Cham in a cartoon underneath which is written: "Everybody
being soldiers, the officers will have the right to put through the
paces anyone whom they meet in the streets." The sketch shows a cook
in the usual culinary costume, and bearing on his head a flat basket
filled with kettles and pans, marking time at the command of an
officer. The attitude of England during the war seemed to the
caricaturist perfidious, after the practical aid which France had
rendered Albion in the Crimea. Cham hits this off by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>(p. 223)</span>
representing the two nations as women, Britannia looking ironically at
prostrate France and saying: "Oh, no! Prussia has not yet entirely
killed her! So it is not yet time to go to her aid."</p>

<p>The statesmen and warriors of that period were very happily
caricatured in a series of cartoons, most of which appeared in
<i>L'Éclipse</i>. Gill excelled in his caricature of individual men rather
than in the caricature of events or groups. His real name was Louis
Alexandre Gosset. He was born at Landouzy-li-Ville, October 19, 1840,
and died in Paris, December 29, 1885. Thiers, Gambetta, Louis Blanc,
all the men of the time, were hit off by his pencil. His method in
most cases consisted of the grotesque exaggeration of the subject's
head at the expense of the body. He was <span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>(p. 224)</span> especially happy in
his caricature of Thiers, whose diminutive size, as well as his great
importance, made him a favorite subject for the cartoonist. Thiers as
Hamlet soliloquizing, "To be or not to be"; Thiers as "The Man Who
Laughs"; the head of Thiers peering over the rim of a glass, "A
tempest in a glass of water"; Thiers as the first conscript of France;
Thiers as Achilles in retreat&mdash;all these and countless others are from
the pencil of Gill.</p>

maliciously alluded to the Emperor. Behind De Morny in the cartoon are

of the theater to take in the money of the dupes whom De Morny can
persuade to enter. To the right and left, in grotesque attire, are the

army under his command to the Germans, finds pictorial expression in
the grim cartoon by Faustin, reproduced here. The artist has cunningly
drawn into the features of the Marshal an expression of unutterable
craft and treachery. Round his neck there has been flung what at the
first glance seems like a decoration of honor, an impression
strengthened by the cross and inscription on his breast. But as you
look more closely you perceive that this decoration is suspended from
the noose of the hangman's rope, and that the words "Au Maréchal
Bazaine&mdash;La France Reconnaissante" have another and a deeper
significance. The defender of the city of Paris, General Trochu, was
genially caricatured by André Gill in <i>L'Éclipse</i> as a <i>blanchisseuse</i>
industriously ironing out the dirty linen of France. However great his
popularity was at the time, Trochu has by no means escaped subsequent
criticism. To him the resistance of Paris seemed nothing but "an
heroic folly," and he had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229"></a>(p. 229)</span> no hesitation about proclaiming
his opinion. Another exceedingly happy caricature by André Gill was
that representing Henri Rochefort, the implacable enemy of Louis
Napoleon, as a member of the Government of the National Defense. Here
Rochefort's head is shown peering out of the mouth of a cannon
projecting through a hole in the city's fortifications.</p>

<i>THE END OF THE CENTURY</i></h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<span class="smaller">THE EVOLUTION OF AMERICAN CARICATURE</span></h3>

<p>During the period covered by the present chapter the foundation of the
two leading American comic weeklies, <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i>, the former in
1877 and the latter in 1881, led to a distinct advance in political
caricature in this country. It also made it possible for the first
time to draw an intelligent comparison between the tendencies of
caricature in England and in America. No one can look over the early
files of <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i> and compare them with <i>Punch</i> for the
corresponding years without being struck with the contrast, not merely
in methods of drawing and printing, but in the whole underlying
spirit. For the past half century <i>Punch</i> has adhered faithfully to
its original attitude of neutrality upon questions of party politics.
Its aim has been to represent the weight of public opinion in a sober
and conservative spirit; to discountenance and rebuke the excesses of
whichever party is in power; to commemorate the great national
calamities, as well as the occasions of national rejoicings. If it
somewhat overstepped its established bounds in its repeated attacks
upon Lord Beaconsfield because his foreign policy was regarded with
distrust, it made amends with an eloquent tribute at the time of that
statesman's death. And if on one occasion it cartooned him in the
guise of the melancholy Dane, with broad impartiality it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232"></a>(p. 232)</span>
travestied his great rival, Gladstone, a month or two later, in
precisely the same character. Taken as a whole, the English cartoons
are not so distinctly popular in tone as those in this country. The
underlying thought is apt to be more cultured, more bookish, so to
speak; to take the form of parodies upon Shakspere and Dante, Dickens
and Scott. And yet, taking them all in all, it would be difficult to
point out any parallel series of cartoons which, after the lapse of
years, require so little explanation to make them intelligible, or
which cover in so comprehensive a manner the current history of the
world.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, the typical American cartoon of a generation ago
concerned itself but little with questions of international interest,
while in its treatment of domestic <span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233"></a>(p. 233)</span> affairs it was largely
lacking in the dignity and restraint which characterized the British
school. Being founded upon party politics, its purpose was primarily
not to reflect public opinion, but to mold it; to make political
capital; to win votes by fair means, if possible, but to win them.
From their very inception <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i>, as the mouthpieces of
their respective parties, have exerted a formidable power, whose
far-reaching influence it would be impossible to gauge, especially
during the febrile periods of the Presidential campaigns. At these
times the animosity shown in some of the cartoons seems rather
surprising, when looked at from the sober vantage ground of later
years. Political molehills were exaggerated into mountains, and even
those elements of vulgar vituperation and cheap personal
abuse&mdash;features of political campaigns which we are happily
outgrowing&mdash;were eagerly seized upon for the purpose of pictorial
satire. The peculiar bitterness which marked the memorable campaign
between Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Blaine in 1884 was strongly mirrored in
the political caricature of the time. It marked the highwater line of
the element of purely personal abuse in comic art. In the end the
extreme measures to which each <span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234"></a>(p. 234)</span> of the rival parties resorted
during that year had very beneficial effects, for after the election
the nation, in calmer mood, grew ashamed at the thought of its
violence and bitterness, and subsequent campaigns have consequently
been much more free from these objectionable features. Mr. Harrison,
Mr. Bryan, Mr. McKinley, and Mr. Roosevelt have all been assailed from
many different points. But we are no longer in the mood to tolerate
attempts to rake up <span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235"></a>(p. 235)</span> alleged personal scandals and to use them
in the pamphlet and the cartoon. Enough of this was done by both
parties in 1884 to last us for at least a generation. There are
cartoons which appeared in <i>Puck</i> and <i>Judge</i> which even at this day
we should not think of reprinting, and which the publications
containing them and the artists who drew them would probably like to
forget.</p>

</div>

<p>Nevertheless, to the close student of political history there is in
the American cartoon of this period, with all its flamboyant
colorings, its reckless exaggeration, its puerile animosity, material
which the more sober and dignified British cartoon does not offer. It
does not sum up so adequately the sober second thought of the nation,
but it does keep us in touch with the changing mood of popular
opinion, its varying pulse-beat from hour to hour. To glance over the
old files throughout any one of the Presidential campaigns is the next
best thing to living them over again, listening once more to the daily
heated arguments, the inflammable stump speeches, the rancorous
vituperation which meant so much at the time, and which seemed so
idle the day after the election.</p>

still holds."</p>
<p class="smaller"><i>By Daumier in "Charivari."</i></p>
</div>

<p>It is not strange that during these years American cartoonists
concerned themselves but little with matters outside of their own
country. For more than a decade after the close of the Franco-Prussian
War there were very few episodes which assumed international
importance, and still fewer in which the United States had any
personal interest. France was amply occupied in recovering from the
effects of her exhaustive struggle; United Germany was undergoing the
process of crystallizing into definite form. Europe, as a whole, had
no more energy than was needed to attend to domestic affairs and to
keeping a jealous eye upon English ambition in Egypt and Russian
aggression in the Balkan States. For some little time after the French
Commune echoes of that internecine struggle were still to be found in
the work of caricaturists, both in France and Germany. Before taking
final leave of that veteran French artist, Honoré Daumier, it seems
necessary to allude briefly to a few of the cartoons of that
splendidly tragic series of his old age dealing with the France which,
having undergone the horrors of the Germanic invasion and of the
Commune, is shattered but not broken, and begins to look forward with
wistful eyes to a time when she shall have recovered her strength and
her prosperity. One of the most striking of these cartoons represents
France as a deep-rooted tree which has been bent and rent by the
passing whirlwind. "Poor France! The branches are broken, but the
trunk holds always." Simple as <span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237"></a>(p. 237)</span> the design is, the artist by
countless touches of light and of shadow has given it a somber
significance which long remains in the memory. It was to Napoleon that
Daumier bitterly ascribed the misfortunes of <i>La Patrie</i>, and in these
cartoons he lost no opportunity of attacking Napoleonic legend. Stark
and dead, nailed to the Book of History is the Imperial eagle. "You
will remain outside, nailed fast on the cover, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238"></a>(p. 238)</span> a hideous
warning to future generations of Frenchmen," is Daumier's moral. Of
brighter nature is the cartoon called "The New Year." It represents
the dawning of 1872, and portrays France sweeping away the last broken
relics of her period of disaster.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>By Daumier in "Charivari."</i></p>
</div>

<p>In Germany, also, one finds a few tardy cartoons bearing upon Napoleon
III. Even in the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>, a periodical which throughout
its history has confined itself, with few exceptions, to social
satire, perennial skits upon the dignified Herr Professor, the
self-important young lieutenant, the punctilious university student,
one famous cartoon appeared late in the year 1871, entitled "The Root
of All Evil." It portrayed Napoleon III., as a gigantic, distorted
vegetable of the carrot or turnip order, his flabby features distended
into tuberous rotundity, the familiar hall-mark of his sweeping
mustache and imperial lengthened grotesquely <span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239"></a>(p. 239)</span> into the
semblance of a threefold root. Still better known is a series of
cartoons which ran through half a dozen numbers of the <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i>, entitled "The Franco-Prussian War: A Tragedy in Five Acts,"
in which the captions are all clever applications of lines from
Schiller's "Maid of Orleans". As compared with the work of really
great cartoonists, this series has little to make it memorable. But as
an expression of a victorious nation's good-natured contempt, its
tendency to view the whole fierce struggle of 1870-71 as an amusing
farce enacted by a company of grotesque marionettes, it is not without
significance and interest.</p>

<p>Almost as Germanic in sentiment and in execution as the "Maid of
Orleans" series in the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i> was the curious little
volume entitled "The Fight at Dame Europa's School," written and
illustrated by Thomas Nast. This skit, which was printed in New York
after the close of the War, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240"></a>(p. 240)</span> contained thirty-three drawings
which are remarkable chiefly in that they are comparatively different
from anything else that Nast ever did and bear a striking resemblance
to the war cartoons of the German papers. The Louis Napoleon of this
book is so much like the Louis Napoleon of the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>
that one is bound to feel that one was the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242"></a>(p. 242)</span> direct
inspiration of the other. The text of the book, though nothing
astonishing, serves its purpose in elucidating the drawings. It tells
of the well-ordered educational establishment kept by Dame Europa in
which the five largest boys acted as monitors, to keep the unruly
pupils in order. These boys were Louis, William, Aleck, Joseph, and
John. If a dispute arose among any of the smaller boys, the monitors
had to examine into its cause, and, if possible, to settle it
amicably. Should it be necessary to fight the matter out, they were to
see fair play, stop the encounter when it had gone far enough, and at
all times to uphold justice, and to prevent tyranny and bullying. In
this work Master Louis and Master John were particularly prominent.
There was a tradition in the school of a terrific row in times past,
when a monitor named Nicholas attacked a very dirty little boy called
Constantine. John and Louis pitched in, and gave Nicholas such a
thrashing that he never got over it, and soon afterward left the
school. Now each of the upper boys had a little garden of his own in
which he took great pride and interest. In the center of each garden
there was an arbor, fitted up according to the taste and means of its
owner. Louis had the prettiest arbor of all, while that of John was a
mere tool-house. When the latter wished to enjoy a holiday he would
punt himself across the brook and enjoy himself in the arbor of his
friend Louis. By the side of Louis's domain was that of William, who,
though proud of his own garden, never went to work in it without
casting an envious glance on two little flower beds which now belonged
to Louis, but which ought by rights he thought to belong to him. Over
these flower beds he often talked with his favorite fag, a shrewd lad
named Mark, full of deep tricks and dodges.</p>

<p>"There is only one way to do it," said Mark. "If you <span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244"></a>(p. 244)</span> want
the flower beds, you must fight Louis for them, and I believe you will
lick him all to smash; but you must fight him alone."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" replied William.</p>

<p>"I mean, you must take care that the other monitors don't interfere in
the quarrel. If they do, they will be sure to go against you. Remember
what a grudge Joseph owes you for the licking you gave him not along
ago; and Aleck, though to be sure Louis took little Constantine's part
against him in that great bullying row, is evidently beginning to grow
jealous of your influence in the school. You see, old fellow, you have
grown so much lately, and filled out so wonderfully that you are
getting really quite formidable. Why, I recollect the time when you
were quite a little chap!"</p>

<p>Thereupon the astute Mark designs a plan by which William may provoke
the encounter while making Louis seem the aggressor. And so on, under
the guise of fistfight between two schoolboys, Nast tells of all the
events of the struggle of 1871; the outbreak of hostilities, the
Baptism of Fire, Sedan, the German march on Paris, the Siege, and the
different attitudes assumed by the other monitors.</p>

<p>Punch, however, is really the most satisfactory and comprehensive
source for the history of political caricature during the years
following the siege of Paris down to 1886. From the indefatigable
pencil of Tenniel and Sambourne we get an exhaustive and pungent
record of the whole period of Disraeli's ascendency, the fruits of his
much-criticised foreign policy, England's attitude regarding the Suez
Canal, her share in the Turco-Russian <span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246"></a>(p. 246)</span> conflict, her
acquisition of the island of Cyprus, the fall of Khartoum, the Fenian
difficulties of 1885, and the history of Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule
policy.</p>

<p>Throughout the cartoons of this period there is no one figure which
appears with more persistent regularity than that of Lord
Beaconsfield, and with scarcely an exception he is uniformly treated
with an air of indulgent contempt. Of course, his strongly marked
features, the unmistakably Semitic cast of nose and lips, the closely
curled black ringlets clustering above his ears, all offered
irresistible temptation to the cartoonist, with the result that
throughout the entire series, in whatever guise he is portrayed, the
suggestion of charlatan, of necromancer, of mountebank, of one kind or
another of the endless genus "fake," is never wholly absent. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247"></a>(p. 247)</span>
Even in Tenniel's cartoon, "New Crowns for Old," which commemorates
the passage of the Royal Titles Bill, conferring upon the Queen the
title of Empress of India, the scene is confessedly adapted from
Aladdin, and "Dizzy" is portrayed as a slippery Oriental with an oily
smile, in the act of trading a gaudy-looking piece of tinsel headgear
for the more modest, but genuine, regal crown topped with the cross of
Malta. The bestowal of the title of Earl of Beaconsfield upon Mr.
Disraeli, which followed within a very few weeks, was too good a
chance for satire for Mr. Tenniel to let pass, and he hit it off in a
page entitled "One Good Turn Deserves Another," in which Victoria,
with the Imperial crown of India upon her head, is conferring a
coronet upon "Dizzy," kneeling obsequiously at her feet.</p>

<p>At this time the one international question which bade fair to assume
any considerable importance was that of Russia's attitude in the
Balkan peninsula. Already in June, 1886, we find <i>Punch</i> portraying
the Czar of Russia as a master of the hounds, just ready to let slip
the leash from his "dogs of war." Servia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and
Herzegovina, in pursuit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248"></a>(p. 248)</span> of the unsuspecting Sultan of Turkey,
while John Bull in the guise of a policeman, is cautiously peering
from behind a fence, evidently wondering whether this is a case which
calls for active interference. It is only a few days later that the
outbreak of an insurrection in Bosnia and Herzegovina hastens a
decision on the part of Europe to "keep the Ring" and let the Sultan
ward off the "dogs of war" single-handed&mdash;an incident duly
commemorated in <i>Punch</i> on June 19. The Turkish atrocities in
Bulgaria, however, aroused public sentiment throughout the Continent
to such a degree that the Powers united in demanding an armistice.
Tenniel's interpretation of this incident takes the form of a
sick-chamber, in which the Sick Man of Europe is surrounded by a corps
of illustrious physicians, Drs. Bull, William I., Francis Joseph and
Company, who are firmly insisting that their patient shall <span class="pagenum"><a id="page249" name="page249"></a>(p. 249)</span>
swallow a huge pill labeled "Armistice"&mdash;"or else there's no knowing
what might happen!" The protocol on Turkish affairs which soon after
this was proposed by Russia and supported by Disraeli, forms the
subject of two suggestive cartoons in <i>Punch</i>. The first, entitled
"Pons Asinorum," depicts the protocol as a make-shift bridge supported
on the docile shoulders of John Bull and the other European Powers,
and spanning a lagoon entitled "Eastern Question." Over this bridge
the Russian bear is stealthily crawling to his desired goal, his eye
half closed in a sly wink, his sides bristling like a veritable
arsenal with weapons. The second cartoon, alluding to the Porte's
rejection of the protocol, represents Disraeli looking disconsolately
upon a smoldering pile of powder kegs and ammunition, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250"></a>(p. 250)</span> over
which he has placed the protocol, twisted into the shape of a
candle-snuffer. "Confound the thing! It is all ablaze!" he ejaculates,
while Lord Hartington reminds him, "Ah, my dear D., paper will burn,
you know!"</p>

<p>The next significant caricature in the <i>Punch</i> series belongs to the
period of actual hostilities between Turkey and Russia, after Plevna
had been completely invested and the Turks were at all points being
steadily beaten back. This caricature, entitled "Tightening the Grip,"
showing the struggling Turk being slowly crushed to death in the
relentless hug of the gigantic bear, may safely be left to speak for
itself without further description. Meanwhile, England was watching
with growing disquiet Russia's actions in the Balkans. In one cartoon
of this period, Mr. Bull is bluntly refusing to be drawn into a game
of "Blind Hookey" with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251"></a>(p. 251)</span> the other European Powers. "Now then,
Mr. Bull, we're only waiting for you," says Russia; and John Bull
rejoins: "Thank you, I don't like the game. I like to see the cards!"
Prince Bismarck at this time was doing his best to bring about an
understanding between England and Russia, but the difficulties of the
situation threatened to prove too much even for that veteran diplomat.
<i>Punch</i> cleverly hit off the situation by representing Bismarck Æolus,
the wind-god, struggling desperately with an unmanageable wind-bag,
which is swelling threateningly in the direction of the East and
assuming the form of a dangerous war-cloud. Eventually all
misunderstandings were peacefully smoothed away at the Berlin
Congress, which Tenniel commemorates with a cartoon showing "Dizzy" in
the guise of a tight-rope performer triumphantly carrying the Sultan
on his shoulders along a rope labeled "Congress," his inherent
double-dealing being suggested by his balancing pole, which he sways
back and forth indifferently, and the opposite ends of which are
labeled "peace" and "war."</p>

dedicated to the memory of President Garfield at the time of the

<p>M. Gambetta seldom received attention at the hands of English
caricaturists; but in 1881, when the resignation of Jules Ferry and
his colleagues resulted in the formation of a new ministry with
Gambetta at the head, and both English and German newspapers were
sarcastically saying that "the Gambetta Cabinet represented only
himself," <i>Punch</i> had to have his little fling at the French
statesman, portraying him as beaming with self-complacence, and
striking an attitude <span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253"></a>(p. 253)</span> in front of a statue of Louis XIV.,
while he echoes the latter's famous dictum, "L'État c'est moi!"</p>

<p>Two cartoons which tell their own story are devoted to Fenianism. The
first commemorates the Ph&oelig;nix Park outrage in which Lord Frederick
Cavendish, the newly appointed Chief Secretary, lost his life. The
cartoon is called "The Irish Frankenstein," and is certainly baleful
enough to do full justice to the hideousness of the crime it is
intended to symbolize. The second cartoon, entitled "The Hidden Hand,"
shows the Fenian monster receiving a bag of gold from a mysterious
hand stretched from behind a curtain. The reference is to a supposed
inner circle of assassins, directed and paid by greater villains who
kept themselves carefully behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Khartoum formed the subject of several <span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254"></a>(p. 254)</span> grim
and forceful pages. "Mirage" was almost prophetic in its conception,
representing General Gordon gazing across the desert, where, by the
tantalizing refraction of the air, he can plainly see the advancing
British hosts, which in reality are destined to arrive too late. "Too
late," in fact, are the very words which serve as a caption of the
next cartoon. Khartoum has fallen, and Britannia, having come upon a
fruitless mission, stands a picture of despair, her face buried upon
her arm, her useless shield lying neglected upon the ground.</p>

<h3><span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255"></a>(p. 255)</span> CHAPTER XXVI<br>
<span class="smaller">THOMAS NAST</span></h3>

<p>It was not until late in the '60's, when Thomas Nast began his
pictorial campaign in the pages of <i>Harper's Weekly</i> against the Ring
which held New York in its clutches, that American caricature could
claim a pencil which entitled it to any sort of consideration from the
artistic point of view. Some of the cartoons which have been
reproduced in earlier papers of this series have possessed
unquestionable cleverness of invention and idea; for instance, many of
those dealing with President Jackson's administration and his
relations with the United States Bank, and some of the purely
allegorical cartoons treating of slavery and of the Civil War. But in
all these there was so much lacking; so many artistic shortcomings
were covered up by the convenient loops. The artists felt themselves
free from any obligation to give expression to the countenances of
their subjects so long as the fundamental idea was there, and the
loops offered an easy vehicle for the utterance of thoughts and
feelings which a modern artist would feel obliged to express in the
drawing itself&mdash;by a skillful quirk of the pencil, an added line, an
exaggerated smile or frown. It was a thoroughly wooden school of
caricature, in which one can find no trace of the splendid suggestion
which the caricaturists should at that time have been drawing from
contemporary masters of the art in France and England.</p>

</div>

<p>Although during the years of his fecundity Thomas Nast drew many
cartoons bearing on events of international importance, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256"></a>(p. 256)</span> his
name will always be remembered, first of all, in connection with the
series through which he held up the extravagances and iniquities of
the Tweed Ring in the pillory of public opinion. He had decided
convictions on other subjects. To the end of his life it was his
nature to feel intensely, even in small matters. But his scorn and
hatred of the corrupt organization that was looting New York became a
positive mania, which was reflected in the cartoons which he literally
hurled week after week against Tweed and his satellites. "I don't care
what they write about me," said Tweed, "but can't you stop those
terrible cartoons?" and in the end they, more than anything else, led
to his downfall, his flight and his capture in Spain, where he was
recognized <span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259"></a>(p. 259)</span> by the police through the likeness Nast had
drawn of him as a kidnaper. But in recognizing Nast's services in
behalf of New York City it is not fair to overlook his work as a
political caricaturist on broader issues. To him we owe also the Gratz
Brown tag to Greeley's coat in the campaign of 1872, the "Rag Baby of
Inflation," the Jackass as emblematic of the Democratic Party, the
Labor Cap and the Full Dinner Pail, which in later years were so much
developed by the cartoonists of <i>Judge</i>. And if to-day, at the
beginning of the twentieth century, we have a school of caricature
which for scope and craftsmanship is equal, if not superior, to that
of any nation of Europe, it is only just to recognize that it was
Thomas Nast who first gave American caricature a dignity and a
meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260"></a>(p. 260)</span> The earliest Presidential election which falls within the
scope of the present chapter, that of 1872, antedates the
establishment of American comic weeklies. The central figure in the
few caricatures which have survived from that year was, of course,
Horace Greeley, whose candidacy at one time was thought seriously to
threaten the fortunes of the Republican Party. The caricatures
themselves, with the exception of those drawn by Thomas Nast, show
little improvement over the caricatures which were executed during the
Civil War. The artists relied entirely upon the traditional loops to
make them intelligible to the public, and the features of the
political characters portrayed were expressionless and wooden. One of
the best of this series was drawn in support of the Horace Greeley
candidacy. Uncle Sam is represented as a landlord and President Grant
as his tenant, a shiftless widow with a dog at her heels and a bottle
of rum in the basket on her arm. The Widow Grant has come to ask for a
new lease. "Well, Uncle Sam," she says, "I've called to see if you
will let me have the White House for four years <span class="pagenum"><a id="page261" name="page261"></a>(p. 261)</span> longer, as I
find the place suits me very well." "No, Marm Grant," retorts Uncle
Sam, shaking his head, "I reckon I'll do no such thing. I've had too
many complaints about you from the neighbors during the last four
years. I'm just sick of you and your tobacco smoke and bull pups, so
I've given the lease to Honest Horace Greeley, who will take better
care of the place than you have."</p>

<p>In another of this series Horace Greeley is represented as the
entering wedge that is splitting the rock of the Republican Party.
Greeley, with a paper hearing the words "Free Trade" in one hand and
one bearing "Protection" in the other, is being hammered into the
cleft in the Republican rock by a huge mallet&mdash;Democratic
Nomination&mdash;wielded by Carl Schurz. "This is rather a novel position
for a stanch old Republican like me," he says. "I begin to feel as if
I was in a tight place." President Grant, with a cigar in his hand,
is looking on complacently. "My friend," he <span class="pagenum"><a id="page262" name="page262"></a>(p. 262)</span> calls out to
Schurz, "you've got a soft thing on your wedge, but your mallet will
kill the man." To which Schurz replies: "I don't care who's killed, if
we succeed in defeating your election." Below, creeping furtively
about the rock, are the figures of Dana, Sumner, Gratz Brown,
Trumbull, Hall, Sweeny, Tweed, and Hoffman of the Ring. "Anything to
beat Grant!" is the cry of these conspirators. "Honesty is the word to
shout, there are so many rogues about," mutters Tweed. "Oh, how freely
we'll win with Greeley," says Hall. "Anything to beat Grant. He
wouldn't make me Collector for New York," are the words of Dana. The
cartoon is a belated specimen of the school of American caricature
which was in vogue in the days of President Jackson.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, <i>Puck</i> was not founded until 1877, too
late to take part in the Tilden-Hayes campaign. When we speak of
<i>Puck</i>, however, we refer, of course, to the edition printed in
English, for, as a matter of fact, twenty-four numbers of a German
<i>Puck</i> were published during the year 1876.</p>

<p>As that year was an important one in American history, these numbers
can by no means he ignored, and despite their <span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264"></a>(p. 264)</span> crude
appearance when contrasted with the <i>Puck</i> of later days, they contain
some of Keppler's most admirable work. For instance, there is the
figure of the tattooed Columbia, the precursor of Gillam's famous
Tattooed Man. This figure appeared in November, 1876, and was the idea
of Charles Hauser, a member of the first editorial staff of the young
weekly. The artist's idea of the unhappy condition of our nation is
shown in the hideous tattooed designs with which Columbia's body is
scarred from head to foot. We can read "Whisky Ring," "Black Friday,"
"Secession," "Tammany," "Election Frauds," "Corruption," "Civil War,"
"Credit Mobilier," and "Taxes." The figure is as repulsive as that
which eight years later drove Mr. Blaine to frenzy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266"></a>(p. 266)</span> A familiar device in the caricature of the later '70's was
that of representing political figures as being headless and placing
their heads in another part of the picture, so that you might adjust
them to suit yourself. In this way the artist did not commit himself
to prophecy and was enabled to please both parties. For instance, an
excellent example of this is shown in the cartoon called "You Pays
Your Money and You Takes Your Choice," drawn by Keppler during the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268"></a>(p. 268)</span> campaign of 1876. Of the two headless figures one is seated
in the window of the White House gesticulating derisively at his
beaten opponent. The other, thoroughly crushed and with a nose of
frightfully exaggerated length&mdash;both Mr. Tilden and Mr. Hayes were
rather large-nosed men&mdash;is leaning helplessly against the wall of the
cold outside. At the bottom of the picture are the heads of the two

<span class="smaller">THE AMERICAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS OF 1880 AND 1884</span></h3>

<p>Probably no cartoon dealing with the Garfield-Hancock campaign of 1880
was more widely discussed than that called "Forbidding the Banns,"
drawn for <i>Puck</i> by Keppler. It was a cartoon which an American comic
paper would publish to-day only after considerable hesitation, for
there was in it the spirit of a less delicate age, a coarseness which
was pardonable only when the genuine strength and humor of the
complete work are taken into consideration. "Forbidding the Banns"
shows a political wedding party at the altar with Uncle Sam as the
reluctant and uncomfortable groom, General Garfield as the eager
bride, and the figure of the ballot box as the officiating clergyman.
The bridesmaids are Mr. Whitelaw Reid and Carl Schurz, with Murat
Halstead bringing up the rear. The ceremony is well along and the
contracting parties are about to be united when W. H. Barnum, the
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, rushes in shouting, "I
forbid the banns!" and waving frantically the figure of a little baby
marked "Credit Mobilier." The faces of all the bridal party show
consternation at the unexpected interruption, while the bride protests
coyly: "But it was such a little one."</p>

<p>The defeat of General Hancock in 1880 was commemorated by Keppler in
<i>Puck</i> with the cartoon called "The Wake over the Remains of the
Democratic Party." The ludicrous corpse of the defunct is stretched
on a rough board <span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271"></a>(p. 271)</span> and covered with a loose sheet. The lighted
candles at the four corners protrude from the necks of bottles, and
the mourners are indulging in a protracted carouse which seems
destined to end in a free fight. In the center of the picture Kelly,
with Ben Butler as a partner, is doing a dance in the most approved
manner of Donnybrook Fair. All about there is the general atmosphere
of turmoil and unnatural excitement, but the figures of Hewitt, Davis,
Belmont, and English are stretched out in a manner indicating that the
festivities of the night have proved too much for them.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, the political caricature
commemorating the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of 1884 was chiefly
remarkable for its extraordinary rancor. There was little, if any,
really good-natured satire underlying these cartoons; they were
designed and executed vindictively, and their main object was to hurt.
Mr. Cleveland's official record in Buffalo, and as Governor of New
York, had been such as to cause many of the more liberal Republicans
to support his candidacy and offered little to the political
cartoonist, so the opponents of Republican caricature found it
expedient to base their attacks on matters of purely personal nature.</p>

method of belittling Mr. Cleveland's capabilities. It was sneeringly
said that much of the success of his administration was due to the
charm, the tact, and the personal magnetism of Mrs. Cleveland, and
this idea was the inspiration of a number of cartoons which were far
from being in the best of taste. One of these which was not
particularly offensive was that entitled "Mr. Cleveland's Best Card."
It was simply a huge playing card bearing the picture of Mrs.
Cleveland. Another much more obnoxious was a curious imitation of the
famous French cartoon "Partant pour la <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273"></a>(p. 273)</span> Syrie," which was
published in Paris after the flight of the Empress Eugénie.</p>

<p>The Democratic cartoonists, besides their use of the Tattooed Man idea
and the alleged scandals in Mr. Blaine's political career, made a
strong point of the soundness and cleanness of Mr. Cleveland's
official record. A typical caricature of this nature was that drawn by
Gillam called "Why They Dislike Him." It represents Mr. Cleveland as a
lion lying on the rock of Civil Service Reform. Perched on the limb of
a tree overhead are a group of chattering monkeys, his political
enemies, who are hurling at him imprecations and abuse because he will
not consent to serve as the cats-paw to pluck the chestnuts for them
out of the political fire. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277"></a>(p. 277)</span> Familiar faces among the group

<p class="smcap">The First "Tattooed Man" Cartoon.</p>
<p class="smaller"><i>By courtesy of the Puck Company.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The most terrible and effective series of cartoons published during
the Cleveland-Blaine campaign was that in which the Republican
candidate appeared as the Tattooed Man in the political show. For many
weeks during the summer and autumn of 1884 Mr. Blaine was assailed
through this figure in the pages of <i>Puck</i>. The story of the origin of
this historic cartoon is as follows: Mr. Bernard Gillam, the artist,
had conceived the idea of a cartoon in which each of the Presidential
possibilities should appear as some sort of freak in a political
side-show. One of these freaks was to be the Tattooed Man, but Mr.
Gillam at first hit upon David Davis as the person to be so
represented. He was describing the proposed cartoon one day in the
office of <i>Puck</i> when Mr. Bunner, who was at that time the editor,
turned suddenly and said: "David Davis? Nonsense! Blaine is the man
for that." The cartoon so conceived was splendidly executed, and
became one of the great pictorial factors in turning the scale of the
election. It stirred Mr. Blaine himself to a point where he resolved
to prosecute the publishers of <i>Puck</i>, and was persuaded from this
course only by the very strongest pressure. The tattoo marks which
were most obnoxious to him were those which spelled out the word
"Bribery." A curious feature of this series was that Mr. Bernard
Gillam was an ardent Republican, voting for Mr. Blaine on election
day, and at the same time that he was executing the Tattooed Man
cartoon in <i>Puck</i> was suggesting equally vindictive caricatures of Mr.
Cleveland and the Democratic party for the rival pages of <i>Judge</i>.</p>

<p>In looking backward over a century of caricature, it is interesting to
ask just what it is that makes the radical difference between the
cartoon of to-day and that of a hundred years ago. That there is a
wide gulf between the comparative restraint of the modern cartoonist
and the unbridled license of Gillray's or Rowlandson's grotesque,
gargoyle types, is self-evident; that comic art, as applied to
politics, is to-day more widespread, more generally appreciated, and
in a quiet way more effective in molding public opinion than ever
before, needs no argument. And yet, if one stops to analyze the
individual cartoons, to take them apart and discover the essence of
their humor, the incisive edge of their irony and satire, one finds
that there is nothing really new in them; that the basic principles of
caricature were all understood as well in the eighteenth century as in
the nineteenth, and that, in many cases, the successful cartoon of
to-day is simply the replica of an old one of a past generation,
modified to fit a new set of facts. When Gilbert Stuart drew his
famous "Gerrymander" cartoon, he was probably not the first artist to
avail himself of the chance resemblance of the geographical contour of
a state or country to some person or animal. He certainly was not the
last. Again and again the map of the United States has been drawn so
as to bring out some significant similarity, as recently when it was
distorted into a ludicrous semblance of Mr. Cleveland, bending low in
proud humility, the living embodiment of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279"></a>(p. 279)</span> principle,
<i>L'État c'est Moi</i>; or again, just before our war with Spain, when it
was so drawn as to present a capital likeness of Uncle Sam, the
Atlantic and Gulf States forming his nose and mouth, the latter
suggestively opened to take in Cuba, which is swimming dangerously
near. <i>Puck's</i> famous "Tattooed Man" was only a new application of an
idea that had been used before; while the representation of a group of
leading politicians as members of a freak show, a circus, or a
minstrel troop, is as old as minstrels or dime <span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281"></a>(p. 281)</span> museums
themselves. Few leading statesmen of the past half century have not at
some time in their career been portrayed as Hamlet, or Macbeth, or
Richard III.; while as for the conventional use of animals and
symbolic figures to represent the different nations, the British Lion
and the Russian Bear, Uncle Sam and French Liberty, these belong to
the raw materials of caricature, dating back to its very inception as
an art. And yet, while the means used are essentially the same as in
the days of Hogarth and Cruikshank, the results are radically
different.</p>

</div>

<p>The reason for this difference may be summed up in a single
word&mdash;Journalism. The modern cartoon is essentially journalistic, both
in spirit and in execution. The spasmodic single sheets of Gillray's
period, huge lithographs that found their way to the public through
the medium of London print shops, were long ago replaced by the weekly
comic papers, while to-day these in turn find formidable rivals in
the cartoons which have become a feature of most of the leading
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282"></a>(p. 282)</span> daily journals. The celerity with which a caricature is now
conceived and executed, thanks to the modern mechanical improvements
and the prevailing spirit of alertness, makes it possible for the
cartoonist to keep pace with the news of the day, to seize upon the
latest political blunder, the social fad of the moment, and hit it off
with a stroke of incisive irony, without fear that it will be
forgotten before the drawing can appear in print. The consequences of
all this modern haste and enterprise are not wholly advantageous. Real
talent is often wasted upon mediocre ideas under the compulsion of
producing a daily cartoon, and again a really brilliant conception is
marred by overhaste in execution, a lack of artistic finish in the
detail. Besides, the tendency of a large part of contemporary
cartoons is toward the local and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283"></a>(p. 283)</span> the ephemeral. This is
especially true of the caricatures which appear during an American
political campaign, in which every petty blunder, every local issue,
every bit of personal gossip, is magnified into a vital national
principle, a world-wide scandal. And when the morning after the
election dawns, the business settles down into its wonted channel,
these momentous issues, and the flamboyant cartoons which proclaimed
them, suddenly become as trivial and as empty as a spent firecracker
or Roman candle.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="smcap">Joseph Keppler of "Puck."</p>
</div>

<p>But another change which the spirit of journalism has wrought in the
contemporary cartoon, and a more vital change than any other, is due
to the definite editorial policy which lies behind it. The dominant
note in all the work of the great cartoonists of the past, in the
English Gillray and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284"></a>(p. 284)</span> the French Daumier, was the note of
individualism. Take away the personal rancor, the almost irrational
hatred of "Little Boney" from Gillray, take away Daumier's mordant
irony, his fearless contempt for Louis Philippe, and the life of their
work is gone. The typical cartoon of to-day is, to a large extent, not
a one-man production at all. It is frequently built up, piecemeal, one
detail at a time, and in the case of a journal like <i>Punch</i> or <i>Judge</i>
or <i>Life</i> often represents the thoughtful collaboration of the entire
staff. In the case of the leading dailies, the cartoon must be in
accord with the settled political policy of the paper, as much as the
leading articles on the editorial page. The individual preferences of
the cartoonist do not count. In fact, he may be doing daily violence
to his settled convictions, or he may find means of espousing both
sides at once, as was the case with Mr. Gillam, who throughout the
Cleveland-Blaine campaign was impartially drawing Democratic cartoons
for <i>Puck</i> and suggesting Republican cartoons for <i>Judge</i> at the same
time.</p>

<p>What the political cartoon will become in the future, it is dangerous
to predict. There is, however, every indication that its influence,
instead of diminishing, is likely to increase steadily. What it has
lost in ceasing to be the expression of the individual mind, the
impulsive product of erratic genius, it has more than gained in its
increased timeliness, its greater sobriety, its more sustained and
definite purpose. At certain epochs in the past it has served as a
vehicle for reckless scandal-mongering and scurrilous personal abuse.
But this it seems to have happily outgrown. That pictorial satire may
be made forceful without the sacrifice of dignity was long ago
demonstrated by Tenniel's powerful work in the pages of <i>Punch</i>. And
there is no doubt that a serious political issue, when presented in
the form of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285"></a>(p. 285)</span> a telling cartoon, will be borne home to the
minds of a far larger circle of average every-day men and women than
it ever could be when discussed in the cold black and white of the
editorial column.</p>

</div>

<p>Another interesting effect of the growing conservative spirit in
caricature is seen in the gradual crystallization of certain definite
symbolic types. Allusion has already been made, in earlier chapters of
this work, to the manner in which the conception of John Bull and
Uncle Sam and other analogous types, has been gradually built up by
almost imperceptible degrees, each artist preserving all the essential
work of his predecessor, and adding a certain indefinable something of
his own, until a certain definite portrait has been produced, a
permanent ideal, whose characteristic features the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page286" name="page286"></a>(p. 286)</span>
cartoonists of the future could no more alter arbitrarily than they
could the features of Bismarck or Gladstone. And not only have these
crystallized types become accepted by the nation at large,&mdash;not only
is Uncle Sam the same familiar figure, tall and lanky, from the New
York <i>Puck</i> to the San Francisco <i>Wasp</i>,&mdash;but gradually these national
types have migrated and crossed the seas, and to-day they are the
common property of comic artists of all nations. John Bull and the
Russian Bear, Columbia and the American Eagle, are essentially the
same, whether we meet them in the press of Canada, Australia, Cape
Colony, or the United States. And for the very reason that there is so
little variety in the obvious features, the mere physical contour, the
subtler differences due to race prejudice and individual limitations
are all the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287"></a>(p. 287)</span> more significant and interesting. There are
cases, and comparatively recent cases, too, where race-prejudice has
found expression in such rampant and illogical violence as prompted
many of the Spanish cartoons during our recent war over Cuba, in which
Americans were regularly portrayed as hogs&mdash;big hogs and little hogs,
some in hog-pens, others running at large&mdash;but one and all of them as
hogs. The cartoonists of the Continent, Frenchmen, Germans, and
Italians alike, have difficulty in accepting the Anglo-Saxon type of
John Bull. Instead, they usually portray him as a sort of sad-faced
travesty upon Lord Dundreary, a tall, lank, much bewhiskered "milord,"
familiar to patrons of Continental farce-comedy. But it is not in
cases like these that race prejudice becomes interesting. There is
nothing subtle or <span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288"></a>(p. 288)</span> suggestive in mere vituperation, whether
verbal or pictorial, any more than in the persistent representation of
a nation by a type which is no sense representative. On the other
hand, the subtle variations of expression in the John Bull of
contemporary American artists, or the Uncle Sam of British caricature,
will repay careful study. They form a sort of sensitive barometer of
public sentiment in the two countries, and excepting during the rare
periods of exceptional good feeling there is always in the
Englishman's conception of Uncle Sam a scarce-concealed suggestion of
crafty malice in place of his customary kindly shrewdness, while
conversely, our portrayal of John Bull is only too apt to convert that
bluff, honest-hearted country gentleman into a sort of arrogant
blusterer, greedy for gain, yet showing the vein of cowardice
distinctive of the born bully.</p>

<span class="smaller">YEARS OF TURBULENCE</span></h3>

<p>In marked contrast to the preceding lengthy period of tranquillity,
the closing decade of the nineteenth century witnessed a succession of
wars and international crises well calculated to stimulate the pencils
of every cartoonist worthy of the name. One has only to recall that to
this period belong the conflict between China and Japan, the brief
clash between Greece and Turkey, the beginning of our policy of
expansion, with the annexation of Hawaii, our own war with Spain, and
England's protracted struggle in the Transvaal, to realize how rich in
stirring events these few years have been, and what opportunities they
offer for dramatic caricature.</p>

The London "Times" and the Spurious Parnell Letters.
</div>

<p>A cartoon produced in an earlier chapter, entitled "Waiting," showed
General Gordon gazing anxiously across the desert at the mirage which
was conjured up by his fevered brain, taking the clouds of the horizon
to be the guns of the approaching British army of relief. Early in
1885 the relief expedition started under the command of General Henry
Stewart, and on February 7 there was published in <i>Punch</i> the famous
cartoon "At Last," showing the meeting between Gordon and the
relieving general. This was a famous <i>Punch</i> slip. That meeting never
occurred. For on February 5, two days before the appearance of the
issue containing the cartoon, Khartoum had been taken by the Mahdi.
The following week Tenniel followed up "At Last" with the cartoon
"Too Late," which <span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>(p. 292)</span> showed the Mahdi and his fanatic
following pouring into Khartoum, while stricken Britannia covers her

<p>The <i>Times</i> challenge to Charles Stewart Parnell was, of course,

involving Parnell in the murders of Lord Frederick Cavendish and Mr.
Burke in Ph&oelig;nix Park, Dublin, in 1882. When these letters were

were by Tenniel. "The Challenge" appeared in the issue of April 30,

<p>A cartoon which marked Tenniel's genius at its height, a cartoon
worthy of being ranked with that which depicted the British Lion's
vengeance on the Bengal Tiger after the atrocities of the Sepoy

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294"></a>(p. 294)</span> of state the young Emperor is leaning complacently looking
down on the grim old pilot, who has descended the ladder and is about
to step into the boat that is to bear him ashore. The original sketch
of this cartoon was finished by Tenniel as a commission from Lord
Rosebery, who gave it to Bismarck. The picture is said to have pleased
both the Emperor and the Prince.</p>

<p>The baccarat scandal at Tranby Croft and the subsequent trial at which
the then Prince of Wales was present as a witness was a rich morsel
for the caricaturist in the early summer of 1891. Not only in England,
but on the Continent and in this country, the press was full of jibes
and banter at the Prince's expense. The German comic paper, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>(p. 295)</span>
<i>Ulk</i>, suggested pictorially a new coat-of-arms for his Royal Highness
in which various playing cards, dice, and chips were much in evidence.
In another issue the same paper gives a German reading from Shakspere
in which it censures the Prince in much the same manner that Falstaff
censured the wild Harry of Henry IV. The London cartoonists all had
their slings with varying good nature. <i>Fun</i> represented the Prince as
the Prodigal Son being forgiven by the paternal British nation. Point
to this cartoon was given by the fact that the pantomime "L'Enfant
Prodigue" was being played at the time in the Prince of Wales'
Theater. The <i>Pall Mall Budget</i> showed the Queen and the Heir Apparent
enjoying a quiet evening over the card table at home. The Prince is
saying: "Ah, well! I must give up baccarat and take to cribbage with
mamma."</p>

<p>The increase in European armament in 1892 suggested to Tenniel the
idea of the cartoon "The Road to Ruin," which appeared November 5 of
that year. It shows the figures of two armed horsemen, France and
Germany, each burdened with armies of four million men, riding along
"The Road to Ruin." Their steeds, weighed down by the burdens they
bear, are faltering in their strides. A cartoon published shortly
afterwards in the London <i>Fun</i> shows the figure of Peace welcoming the
emperors of Germany and Austria, and urging them hospitably to lay

<p>The brief war between China and Japan was necessarily of a nature to
suggest cartoons of infinite variety. It was the quick, aggressive
bantam against a huge but unwieldy opponent, and one of the earliest
cartoons in <i>Punch</i> utilized <span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>(p. 299)</span> this idea in "The Corean Cock
Fight." The big and clumsy Shanghai is warily watching his diminutive
foe, while the Russian bear, contentedly squatting in the background,
is saying softly to himself: "Hi! whichever wins, I see my way to a
dinner." Every feature of Chinese life offered something to the
caricaturists. For instance, in a cartoon entitled "The First
Installment," London <i>Fun</i> shows the Jap slashing off the Chinaman's
pigtail. Now this idea of the pigtail in one form or another was
carried through to the end of the war. For example the Berlin <i>Ulk</i>
offers a simple solution of the whole controversy in a picture
entitled "How the Northern Alexander Might Cut the Corean Knot." China
and Japan, with their pigtails hopelessly tangled in a knot labeled
"Corea," are tugging desperately in opposite directions, while Russia,
knife in one hand and scissors in the other, is preparing to cut off
both pigtails close to the heads of his two victims.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> characteristically represented the contending nations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>(p. 300)</span> as two boys engaged in a street fight, while the various
powers of Europe are looking on. John Chinaman has obviously had very
much the worst of the fray; his features are battered; he is on the
ground, and bawling lustily, "Boo-hoo! he hurtee me welly much! No
peacey man come stoppy him!" The end of the war was commemorated by
Toronto <span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>(p. 302)</span> <i>Grip</i> in a tableau showing a huge Chinaman on his
knees, while a little Jap is standing on top of the Chinaman's head
toying with the defeated man's pigtail. <i>Kladderadatsch</i>, of Berlin,
printed a very amusing and characteristic cartoon when the war was at
an end: "Business at the death-bed&mdash;Uncle Sam as Undertaker." This
pictorial skit alludes to the proposition from the United States that
China pay her war indemnity to Japan in silver. It shows a stricken
Chinaman tucked in a ludicrous bed and about to breathe his last.
Uncle Sam, as an enterprising undertaker, has thrust his way in and
insists on showing the dying man his handsome new style of coffin.</p>

<p>Still another clever cartoon in which the <i>Kladderadatsch</i> summed up
the situation at the close of the war shows a map <span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304"></a>(p. 304)</span> of the
eastern hemisphere, distorted into a likeness of a much-perturbed
lady, the British Isles forming her coiffure, Europe her arms and
body, and Asia the flowing drapery of her skirts. Japan, saw in hand,
has just completed the amputation of one of her feet&mdash;Formosa&mdash;and has
the other&mdash;Corea&mdash;half sawn off. "Does it hurt you up there?" he is
asking, gazing up at the European portion of his victim. The same
periodical a few months later forcibly called attention to the fact
that while France and Russia were both profiting by the outcome of the
war, Germany was likely to go away empty-handed. It is entitled "The
Partition of the Earth: an Epilogue to the Chinese Loan." China,
represented as a fat, overgrown mandarin, squatting comfortably on his
throne, serene in the consciousness that his financial difficulties
are adjusted for the time being, is explaining the situation to Prince
Hohenlohe, who is waiting, basket in hand, for a share of the spoils.
On one side Russia is bearing off a toy engine and train of cars,
labeled "Manchuria," and on the other France is contentedly jingling
the keys to a number of Chinese seaports. "The world has been given
away," China is saying; "Kwangtung, Kwangsi, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306"></a>(p. 306)</span> and Yünnan are
no longer mine. But if you will live in my celestial kingdom you need
not feel any embarrassment; your uselessness has charmed us
immensely."</p>

<p>The Boulanger excitement, which so roused France until the bubble was
effectually pricked by the lawyer Floquet's fencing sword, was
satirized by <i>Judge</i> in a cartoon entitled "The Noisy Boy in the
European Lodging House." The scene is a huge dormitory in which the
various European powers have just settled down in their separate beds
for a quiet night's rest when Boulanger, with a paper cap on his head,
comes marching through, loudly beating a drum. In an instant all is
turmoil. King Humbert of Italy is shown in the act of hurling his
royal boot at the offending intruder. The Czar of Russia has opened
his eyes and his features are distorted with wrath. Bismarck is
shaking his iron fist. The Emperor of Austria is getting out of bed,
apparently with the intention of inflicting dire punishment on the
interrupter of his slumbers. Even the Sultan of Turkey, long
accustomed to disturbances from all quarters, has joined in the
popular outcry. The lodgers with one voice are shouting, "Drat that
Boy! Why doesn't he let us have some rest?"</p>

<p>The old allegorical ideal of Christian passing through the dangers of
the Valley of the Shadow of Death in Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
which has been appearing in caricature every now and then since
Gillray used it against Napoleon, was employed by Tenniel in a cartoon
of Mr. Gladstone and Home Rule published in <i>Punch</i>, April 15, 1893.
The old warrior, sword in hand, is making his way slowly along the
narrow and perilous wall of Home Rule. On either side are the bogs of
disaster, suggestive of his fate in case his foot should slip.</p>

<p>The Panama scandals in France and the ensuing revelations <span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307"></a>(p. 307)</span> of
general political trickery suggested one of Sambourne's best cartoons,
that depicting France descending into the maelstrom of corruption.
This cartoon appeared in the beginning of 1893. It shows France in the
figure of a woman going supinely over the rapids, to be hurled into
the whirlpool below.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>From "Kladderadatsch" (Berlin).</i></p>
</div>

<p>British feeling on the Fashoda affair was summed up by Tenniel in two
cartoons which appeared in October and November, in 1898. The first
of these called "Quit-Pro <span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308"></a>(p. 308)</span> Quo?" was marked by a vindictive
bitterness which appeared rather out of place in the <i>Punch</i> of the
last quarter of the century. But it must be remembered that for a
brief time feeling ran very high in both countries over the affair. In
this cartoon France is represented as an organ-grinder who persists in
grinding out the obnoxious Fashoda tune to the intense annoyance of
the British householder. The second cartoon represents the Sphinx with
the head of John Bull. John Bull is grimly winking his left eye, to
signify that he regards himself very much of a "fixture" in Egypt.</p>

<span class="smaller">AMERICAN PARTIES AND PLATFORMS</span></h3>

<p>The dangerous condition in which the United States found itself about
the time we began the building of our new and greater navy was
depicted in <i>Judge</i> by the cartoon entitled, "Rip Van Winkle Awakes at
Last." It shows a white-bearded, white-haired Uncle Sam seated on a
rock about which the tide is rapidly rising, looking round at the
great modern armaments of England and France and Germany and Italy,
and murmuring, as he thinks of his own antiquated wooden ships of war
and brick forts, "Why, I'm twenty years behind the age." In his old
hat, with the broken crown, are the feathers of Farragut, Perry, Paul
Jones, and Lawrence, but these alone are not enough, nor will even the
"Spirit of '76," which hovers over him in the shape of an eagle, quite
suffice. He has his musket of 1812 and his muzzle-loading gun of 1864,
but in the background are those huge cannon of European foes and above
them is the gaunt, grim figure of a helmeted Death. A little more and
it would have been too late. Now there is yet time. Rip Van Winkle
awakes at last.</p>

<p>An interesting variant upon the old type of "Presidential
Steeplechase" cartoons appeared in <i>Puck</i> during the summer of 1892,
after the Republican convention at Minneapolis and the Democratic
convention at Chicago had respectively nominated Mr. Harrison and Mr.
Cleveland. The cartoon is entitled "They're Off!" and is drawn with
admirable spirit. The scene is a Roman amphitheater, and the two
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310"></a>(p. 310)</span> Presidential candidates, in the guise of charioteers, are
guiding their mettlesome steeds in a mad gallop around the arena. Mr.
Cleveland's horses, "Tariff Reform" and "Economy," are running
steadily, and seem to be slowly forging to the front, while those of
Mr. Harrison, "High Protection" and "Force Bill," are not pulling well
together, and with ears pointed forward, look as though they might at
any moment become unmanageable.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>By Gillam in "Judge."</i></p>
</div>

<p>In connection with this campaign of 1892, there was no cartoon of more
interest than that entitled "Where Am I At?" which Bernard Gillam
drew for <i>Judge</i>, and this interest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311"></a>(p. 311)</span> lies less in the cartoon
itself than in the amusing story of its conception and execution.
Right up to election day not only Gillam, but the entire staff of
<i>Judge</i>, were perfectly confident of Republican success at the polls.
To them the election seemed to be a mere formality which had to be
gone through with, in order that General Harrison might remain in the
White House for four years more. So a conference was held, after which
Mr. Gillam began work on the cartoon which was to commemorate the
Republican victory. The idea used was that of a general smash-up, with
Mr. Cleveland in the middle of the <i>débâcle</i> and the Republican
elephant marching triumphantly over the ruins. Along these lines a
double-page cartoon was drawn with an immense variety of detail,
reproduced, and made ready for the press. Election Day came around,
and a few hours after the polls had been closed it became evident, to
the consternation of Mr. Gillam and his associates, that instead of
the expected Republican victory, Mr. Cleveland had swept the country
by overwhelming <span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313"></a>(p. 313)</span> majorities. What was to be done? It was too
late to prepare another cartoon, so that the plate already made was
taken from the press, and the cartoonist set to work. To the
discomfited countenance of Mr. Cleveland Gillam attached a beard which
transformed the face into a likeness to that of the defeated
Republican candidate. A huge patch drawn over one of the eyes of the
Republican elephant changed its appearance of elation to one of the
most woe-begone depression. Other slight changes in the legends here
and there throughout the picture transformed its nature to such an
extent that only the most practiced eye could detect anything that was
not wholly spontaneous and genuine. To cap it all, in a corner of the
picture Gillam drew a likeness of himself in the form of a monkey
turning an uncomfortable somersault. With a knowledge of these facts
the reader by a close examination of this cartoon, which is reproduced
in this volume, will undoubtedly detect the lines along which the
lightning change was made. Nevertheless, it will be impossible for him
to deny that the transformation was cleverly done.</p>

<p class="smcap">The Political Columbus who will not land in 1892.</p>
<p class="smaller"><i>By Gillam in "Judge."</i></p>
</div>

<p>Besides being the year of the Presidential campaign, 1892 was a year
when the thoughts of Americans were turned backward four centuries to
the time when Christopher Columbus first landed on the shore of the
Western Hemisphere. The original ships of Columbus's fleet were being
brought over the water from Spain; the Columbus idea was being
exploited everywhere in topical song and light opera; and it would
have been strange indeed if it had failed to play some part in
political caricature. Gillam in <i>Judge</i> made use of it in the cartoon
entitled "The Political Columbus Who Will NOT Land in '92." It
represents the ship of the Democracy with Mr. Cleveland as Columbus
gazing anxiously and uneasily <span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315"></a>(p. 315)</span> at the horizon. At the bow of
the ship is the lion's head and the shield of Britannia, in allusion
to Mr. Cleveland's alleged pro-English sympathies. The sail upon which
the ship is relying for its progress is marked "Free Trade" and is a
woefully patched and weather-beaten bit of canvas. The crew of the
ship is a strange assortment which suggests all sorts of mutiny and
piracy. In the front of the vessel and close behind the captain are
Dana, Croker, Sheehan, and Hill. Beyond them we see the figures of
Cochran, Carlisle, Crisp, Brice, and Mills and Flower. In the far aft
are Blackburn and Gorman. Evidently crew and captain are animated by
despair, although the gull, bearing the features of Mr. Pulitzer, of
the New York <i>World</i>, that is circling around the ship, shows that
land is not so many miles away. "I don't see land," cries
Cleveland-Columbus. And the despairing crew, pointing to the Free
Trade sail, calls back, "And you never will with that rotten canvas."</p>

<p>In contrast with the vindictive and malicious character of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316"></a>(p. 316)</span>
the cartoons which heralded Mr. Cleveland's first election, there was
a marked absence of unpleasant personalities in those which belong to
the period of his second term. There was no disposition, however, to
spare him in regard to the growing difficulty he had in holding his
party together or his assumption of what Republicans regarded as an
entirely unwarranted degree of authority. This autocratic spirit was
cleverly satirized by a cartoon in <i>Judge</i>, to which allusion has
already been made. It consists simply of a map of the United States so
drawn as to form a grotesque likeness of the President. He is bending
low in an elaborate bow, in which mock-humility and glowing
self-satisfaction are amusingly blended, his folded hands forming the
Florida peninsula, his coat-tails projecting into lower California.
Beneath is inscribed the following paraphrase:</p>

<p class="poem">
  My country, 'tis of ME,<br>
  Sweet land of liberty,<br>

<p>Mr. Cleveland's troubles with his party began early in his second
administration. As early as April we find him depicted by <i>Judge</i> as
the "Political Bull in the Democratic China-Shop." The bull has
already had time to do a vast amount of havoc. The plate-glass window,
commanding a view of the national capitol, is a wreck, and the floor
is strewn with the remains of delicate cups and platters, amidst which
may still be recognized fragments of the "Baltimore Machine," "Rewards
for Workers," "Wishes of the Leaders," etc. An elaborate vase, marked
"N. Y. Machine," and bearing a portrait of Senator Hill, is just
toppling over, to add its fragments to the general wreckage.</p>

<p>The general depression of trade and the much-debated issue of tariff
reform recur again and again in the caricatures <span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318"></a>(p. 318)</span> of the
second Cleveland administration, especially after the Republican
landslide of 1893. Thus, in December of that year, a significant
cartoon in <i>Judge</i> represents the leading statesmen of each party
engaged in a game of "National Football," the two goals being
respectively marked "Protection" and "Free Trade." "Halfback" Hill is
saying, "Brace up, Cap; we've got the ball," and Captain Grover,
nursing a black eve, rejoins disconsolately, "That's all very well,
boys, but they've scored against us, and we've got to put up the game
of our lives to beat them." In January the same periodical published a
pessimistic sketch, showing Uncle Sam, shivering with cold, and his
hands plunged deep into his pockets, gloomily watching the mercury in
the "Industrial Thermometer" sinking steadily lower from protection
and plenty, through idleness, misery, and starvation, to the zero
point of free trade. "Durn the Democratic weather, anyway," says Uncle
Sam. A more hopeful view of the situation found expression in <i>Puck</i>,
in a cartoon entitled "Relief at Hand." Labor, in the guise of an
Alpine traveler, has fallen by the wayside, and lies half buried
beneath the snows of the "McKinley Tariff." Help, however, has come,
in the form of a St. Bernard, named "Wilson Tariff Bill," while
Cleveland, in the guise of a monk, is hastening from the neighboring
monastery, drawn in the semblance of the national capitol. Still
another cartoon harping on the need of tariff reform represents
McKinley and the other leading Republicans as "Ponce de Leon and His
Followers," gathered around a pool labeled "High Protection Doctrine."
"They think it is the fountain of political youth and strength, but it
is only a stagnant pool that is almost dried up." Among the many
caricatures in which <i>Judge</i> supported the opposite side, and heaped
ridicule on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320"></a>(p. 320)</span> the Wilson Bill, one of the best shows Uncle Sam
retiring for the night, and examining with disgust and wrath the
meager crazy quilt (the Wilson Bill) with which he has been provided
in lieu of blankets. "I'll freeze to death," he is grumbling, "and yet
some of those idiots call this a protective measure."</p>

<p>Mr. Cleveland's determination to return to the South the flags
captured in the War of Secession, in the hopes of putting an end to
sectional feeling, brought down upon his head the wrath of the more
extreme Republican element, a wrath <span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321"></a>(p. 321)</span> which was reflected
strongly, editorially and pictorially, in the papers of the day. This
suggested to <i>Judge</i> the cartoon entitled "Halt," in which Mr.
Cleveland, in the act of handing back the captured flags, is
restrained by the spirit of Lincoln, which says, "Had you fought for
those flags you would not be so quick to give them away!" To which Mr.
Cleveland is made to reply, "Great Scott! I thought you were dead and
forgotten long ago. I only meant to please Mr. Solid South. They're
rubbish, anyhow." This is another cartoon from the hand of the
prolific Gillam.</p>

<p>The movement for the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, which
occurred in the spring of 1893, and which many Americans were inclined
to regard with suspicion and disfavor, was commemorated in a great
variety of cartoons, both in this country and abroad. It was only
natural that a movement which owed its inception to a Republican
administration, should receive the cordial approval and indorsement of
<i>Judge</i>. A cartoon, dated February 18, represents Columbia in the
guise of an exemplary modern school-mistress, serenely holding in
order her turbulent class of mingled Chinese, negroes, Indians,
Italian organ-grinders, and Russian anarchists, while she gives a
cordial welcome to the small, half-naked new scholar from the Pacific,
who is timidly begging to be admitted. Canada, represented as a demure
little maiden, stands just behind Hawaii, an interested spectator,
apparently more than half inclined to follow his example. In much the
same spirit was a design that appeared in the <i>Wasp</i>, representing
Uncle Sam in the character of St. Peter, holding the key to America's
political paradise. "Poor little imp," he is saying to the Hawaiian
applicant, "I don't see why I should shut you out, when I've let in
all the tramps of the world already." Another cartoon which appeared
in <span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322"></a>(p. 322)</span> <i>Judge</i> was entitled, "The Champion Masher of the
Universe." This represents Hawaii under the form of a dusky but comely
damsel, being borne off complacently by a gorgeously attired Uncle
Sam, while his discomfited rivals are looking on in chagrin and
disgust. These rivals are England, under the form of John Bull;
France, shown under the features of President Sadi Carnot; Germany,
the Emperor William; and Italy, King Humbert. This cartoon was drawn
by Gillam.</p>

<p class="smcap">The End of the Chilian Affair.</p>
<p class="smaller"><i>From "Judge."</i></p>
</div>

<p>The Toronto <i>Grip</i> saw the matter in quite a different aspect. Hawaii,
a badly frightened savage, is bound to a stake, while Uncle Sam, in
the guise of a missionary, is whetting the knife of annexation,
preparing to give him the <i>coup-de-grace</i>, and at the same time waving
off John Bull, who holds his knife, "Protectorate," with similar
intent. "Hold up," says Hawaii, "didn't you say it was wrong to eat
man?" and Uncle Sam rejoins benevolently, "Yes&mdash;but&mdash;well, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323"></a>(p. 323)</span>
circumstances alter cases, and the interests of civilization and
commerce, you know &mdash;&mdash; You keep off, John; he's my meat." The
suggestion that England was merely waiting for a good excuse to step
in and take possession of Hawaii, while the American administration
and Congress were trying to reach an understanding, was eagerly seized
upon by other journals as well as <i>Grip</i>, especially in Germany. The
Berlin <i>Ulk</i> portrayed Queen Liliuokalani, armed with a broom, angrily
sweeping Uncle Sam from his foothold in Honolulu, while John Bull,
firmly established on two of the smaller islands, "laughs to his
heart's content," so the legend runs, "but the Yankee is mad with
rage." In similar spirit the <i>Kladderadatsch</i> depicts John Bull and
Uncle Sam as "Two Good Old Friends," trying to "balance their
interests in the Pacific Ocean." With clasped hands the two rivals are
see-sawing backwards and forwards, each striving to retain a
precarious foothold, as they straddle the Pacific from Samoa to
Hawaii, and each quite oblivious of the discomfort of the squirming
little natives that they are crushing under heel.</p>

<p>The fiasco of Mr. Cleveland's attempt to restore Queen Liliuokalani to
her throne was hit off in <i>Judge</i> by a cartoon portraying him as Don
Quixote, physically much the worse for wear, as a result of his latest
tilt at the Hawaiian windmill. The knight's spirit, however, is

<p>Another cartoon of sterling literary flavor is that representing Mr.
McKinley as a political Tam o' Shanter, which appeared during the
exciting election of 1896. The countenance of Tam in this cartoon
shows none of the anxiety and mental perturbation of the hero of
Burns' poems. You <span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325"></a>(p. 325)</span> can see that he has full confidence in his
good mare, "National Credit," and is perfectly convinced that she will
carry him unscathed over the road to Good Times, Prosperity, and
Protection. The carlins have been close at his mare's heels, however,
and as he passes the bridge over which they dare <span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327"></a>(p. 327)</span> not cross,
the foremost of his pursuers has caught and pulled away as a trophy
the tail of the steed. The tail, however, is something with which he
can well part, for it typifies four years of business depression. The
leaders of the pursuing carlins are Free Trade, Anarchy, Sectionalism,
and Popocracy.</p>

<p>Mr. Bryan's appeal to the farmer in 1896 was hit off by Hamilton in a
powerful, but exceedingly blasphemous, cartoon entitled "The
Temptation." Bryan in the form of a huge angel of darkness has taken
the farmer to the top of a high mountain to show him the riches of the
world. As far as the eye can see stretch oceans and cities and hills
and rivers and mountains of silver. It is a great pity that so grim
and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328"></a>(p. 328)</span> powerful a cartoon should have been marred by that
display of bad taste which has been too frequent in the history of
caricature.</p>

<p>The caricature produced by the campaign between Mr. McKinley and Mr.
Bryan in 1900 offers few, if any, cartoons more admirable than that by
Mr. Victor Gillam, representing Don Quixote Bryan meeting disaster in
his fight against the full dinner pail. This cartoon has that literary
flavor which has been too much lacking in American caricature, and
which raises this particular cartoon far above the average in the same
school. The idea, of course, is based on Don Quixote's disastrous
encounter with the windmill, which that poor crack-brained gentleman
took to be a giant. The body of the windmill is a huge dinner pail
and its arms are a crossed knife <span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329"></a>(p. 329)</span> and fork. Don Quixote,
incased in armor from head to foot, and mounted on the Democratic
donkey with free silver for a saddle, has tilted against the solid
structure with disastrous results. His lance is shattered, and he and
his faithful steed lie prostrate and discomfited on opposite sides of
the road. The Sancho Panza needed to complete the picture appears
under the familiar features of Mr. Richard Croker, who, leading the
Tammany Tiger by a rope, is hurrying to his master's assistance. In
the distance may be seen the White House, but the road in that
direction is completely barred by the stanch windmill that has so
successfully resisted the mad knight's onslaught.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR</span></h3>

<p>The pent-up feeling throughout the United States, which reached a
dangerous degree of tension during the weeks preceding the declaration
of war against Spain, was forcibly symbolized in the Minneapolis
<i>Herald</i>. The dome of the National Capitol is portrayed, surmounted by
a "Congressional safety-valve." McKinley, clinging to the cupola, is
anxiously listening to the roar of the imprisoned steam, which is
escaping in vast "war clouds," in spite of all the efforts of Speaker
Reed, who is freely perspiring in his effort to hold down the valve.</p>

<p class="smcap">Be Careful! It's Loaded!</p>
<p class="smaller"><i>By Victor Gillam in "Judge."</i></p>
</div>

<p>One of those cartoons which are not to be forgotten in a day or a week
or a month; one which stirs the blood and rouses the mind to a new
patriotism even when seen years after the events which inspired it, is
Victor Gillam's "Be Careful! It's Loaded!" which appeared a few weeks
before the outbreak of the Spanish-American War and which we deem
worthy of being ranked among the twenty-five or thirty great cartoons
which the nineteenth century has produced. To realize to-day its full
force and meaning one has to recall the peculiar tension under which
the American people were laboring during the months of February,
March, and April, 1898. The <i>Maine</i> had been destroyed in Havana
Harbor, and although, now that anger has died down, we can no longer
cling implacably to the belief, which was then everywhere expressed,
that it was an act emanating from the Spanish Government, at the time
it was too much for our overwrought <span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333"></a>(p. 333)</span> nerves; the condition
of Cuba was growing every day more deplorable, and everyone felt that
the inevitable conflict was hourly at hand. In the picture American
patriotism is symbolized by a huge cannon. A diminutive Spaniard has
climbed to the top of a mast of a Spanish vessel and monkey-like is
shaking his fist down the muzzle. Uncle Sam, standing by the gun and
realizing the Spaniard's imminent peril calls out, excitedly, "Be
Careful! It's Loaded!" a warning to which the latter seems little
inclined to pay any attention. In its very simplicity this cartoon
differs greatly from most of those of the school of <i>Puck</i> and
<i>Judge</i>. There is none of that infinite variety of detail which makes
an elaborate study necessary in order to arrive at a full
comprehension of the meaning of a cartoon. "Be Careful! It's Loaded!"
like the most striking English and French cartoons, may be understood
at a glance.</p>

we find amusing at the present time. We did not find it so a little
over five years ago. This latest war bulletin, printed in asbestos, is
supposed to have been just received from the infernal regions. His
Satanic majesty, with a sardonic grin upon his face, has just composed
it to his own entire satisfaction. Marked up on the burning furnace of

<p>Another equally hideous cartoon by Hamilton is that entitled "The
Spanish Brute Adds Mutilation to Murder." It shows a hideous ape-like
monster representing Spain, one blood-dripping hand smearing the
tombstones erected to the sailors of the <i>Maine</i> and the other
clutching a reeking knife. All about him under the tropical trees are
the bodies of his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337"></a>(p. 337)</span> mutilated victims. The expression of the
monster's countenance is a lesson in national prejudice. It shows how
far a well-balanced nation may go in moments of bitterness and anger.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most striking and amusing of all the cartoons evoked by the
results of the Spanish-American War appeared in <i>Punch</i> at a time when
our departure from our traditional policy began to cause comment in
Europe. There are two figures, that of Dame Europa and that of Uncle
Sam. Dame Europa is a lady of frigid aspect, with arms folded, and who
has drawn herself up to full height as she gazes scornfully at the
complacent and unruffled Uncle Sam. "To whom do I owe the honor of
this intrusion?" she asks icily. "Marm, my name is Uncle Sam." "Any
relation of the late Colonel Monroe?" is the scathing retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338"></a>(p. 338)</span> No less interesting than the American cartoons of the Spanish
War are those contributed by Spain herself, although in the light of
subsequent events they are chiefly amusing for their overweening
confidence and braggadocio insolence. Among the more extravagant
flights of Spanish imagination, which later news turned into
absurdities, may be cited "Dewey's Situation," in which the victor of
Manila is represented as a disconsolate rat, caught in the Philippine
mouse-trap; "Cervera bottles up Schley," a situation which the sober
facts of history afterwards reversed; and "McKinley's Condition," in
which the President is represented as swathed in bandages, and
suffering severely from apocryphal injuries received at Porto Rico and
Cienfuegos. All of these cartoons appeared at different times in the
Madrid <i>Don Quijote</i>, which did not always keep on this level of empty
boasting, but occasionally produced some really clever caricature. A
regular feature of the Spanish War cartoons was the American Hog as a
symbol of the United States, and some of the applications of this idea
in the <i>Don Quijote</i> were distinctly amusing. For instance, in
reference to Spain's accusation that an American ship flew the Spanish
flag at Guantanamo in order to approach near enough to cut the cable,
America is shown as a fat hog, triumphantly strutting along on its
hind legs and ostentatiously waving the Spanish colors. Again, the
Sampson-Schley controversy is hit off in a picture showing Sampson
surrounded by a number of naval "hogs," each armed with gigantic
shears and bent upon obtaining the Admiral's scalp. Still another
cartoon seeks to explain the "real purpose" in getting Cuba away from
Spain. A drove of pigs have clustered around a huge barrel of Cuban
molasses and are eagerly sucking the contents through tubes. Of a
more dignified type are the caricatures <span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341"></a>(p. 341)</span> representing Spain
as a beautiful and haughty Señorita, boldly showing how she keeps
beneath her garter "a knife for the American pigs"; or pointing to her
shoe on which Cuba serves as a buckle, and arrogantly challenging a
diminutive McKinley, "you can't unbuckle that shoe!"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BOER WAR AND THE DREYFUS CASE</span></h3>

<p>A cartoon which was a forerunner of the Transvaal War and the railway
between Capetown and Cairo was that entitled "The Rhodes Colossus,"
which appeared in <i>Punch</i> December 10, 1892. It was by the hand of
Linley Sambourne. It shows a colossal figure of Cecil Rhodes standing
on a map of Africa with one foot planted in Egypt and the other at the
Cape. In his hands he holds a line suggesting the telegraph wire
connecting the two places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344"></a>(p. 344)</span> Although the German Government refused to interfere in the
protracted struggle in the Transvaal, the sympathy of Germany with the
Boers found expression in a host of cartoons, bitterly inveighing
against British aggression. Thoroughly characteristic is one which
appeared in the <i>Lustige Blätter</i> entitled "English World-Kingdom; or,
Bloody Cartography." A grossly distorted caricature of Victoria is
standing before a map of the world, and dipping her pen in a cup of
blood, held for her by an army officer. Chamberlain, at her elbow, is
explaining that "the lowest corner down yonder, must be painted red!"
Another of the <i>Lustige Blätter's</i> grim cartoons, alluding to the
terrible price in human life that England paid for her ultimate
victory in the Transvaal, depicts Britannia, as Lady Macbeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345"></a>(p. 345)</span> vainly trying to wash the stain from her bloody hands. "Out,
damned spot!" In lighter vein is the cartoon which is here reproduced
from the <i>Wiener Humoristische Blätter</i> showing "Oom Paul at His
Favorite Sport." Kruger, rakishly arrayed in tennis garb, is
extracting infinite enjoyment from the congenial exercise of volleying
English soldiers, dressed up as shuttlecocks, over the "Transvaal net"
into the watery ditch beyond.</p>

<p>Judged by the manner it was mirrored in the caricature of Europe and
America, the Dreyfus Case assumed the magnitude of a great war or a
crisis in national existence. During the last two or three years that
the degraded Captain of Artillery was a prisoner at Devil's Island,
when Zola was furiously accusing, and the General Staff was talking
about <span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347"></a>(p. 347)</span> "the Honor of the Army," and France was divided into
two angry camps, one had only to glance at the current cartoons to
realize that Dreyfus was, as the late G. W. Steevens called him, "the
most famous man in the world." For a time the great personages of the
earth were relegated to the background. The monarchs and statesmen of
Europe were of interest and importance only so far as their careers
affected that of the formerly obscure Jewish officer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous of all the admirable cartoons dealing with
<i>l'Affaire</i> was the "Design for a New French Bastile," which was of
German origin and which caused the paper publishing it to be excluded
from French territory. It appeared just after Colonel Henry had cut
his throat with a razor in his cell in the Fortress of Vincennes, when
suspicions of collusion were openly expressed, and some went so far as
to hint that the prisoner's death might be a case of murder and not
suicide. The "Design for a New French Bastile" <span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349"></a>(p. 349)</span> showed a
formidable fortress on the lines of the famous prison destroyed in the
French Revolution with a row of the special cells beneath. In one of
these cells a loaded revolver was placed conspicuously on the chair;
in the next was seen a sharpened razor; from a stout bar in a third
cell dangled a convenient noose. The inference was obvious, and the
fact that the cells were labeled "for Picquart," "for Zola," "for
Labori" and the other defenders of Dreyfus gave the cartoon an added
and sinister significance. In caricature the Dreyfus case was a battle
between a small number of Anti-Dreyfussard artists on the one hand,
and the Dreyfus press with all the cartoonists of Europe and the
United States as its allies on the other. The opportunity to exalt the
prisoner, to hold him up as a martyr, to interpret pictorially the
spirit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350"></a>(p. 350)</span> of Zola's ringing "<i>la vérité est en marche, et rien
ne l'arrêtera</i>!" offered a vast field for dramatic caricature. On the
other hand the cartoon against Dreyfus and his defenders was
essentially negative, and the wonder is that the rout of the minority
was not greater&mdash;it should have been a veritable "<i>sauve qui peut</i>."</p>

<p>The spirit of anti-Dreyfussard caricature was Anti-Semitism. One of
the most striking of the cartoons on this side purported to contrast
France before 1789 and France at the end of the Nineteenth Century.
In the first picture we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351"></a>(p. 351)</span> were shown a peasant toiling
laboriously along a furrow in the ground, bearing on his shoulders a
beribboned and beplumed aristocrat of the old régime, whose thighs
grip the neck of the man below with the tenacity of the Old Man of the
Sea. That was France before the Revolution came with its bloody
lesson. In the picture showing France at the end of the Nineteenth
Century there was the same peasant toiling along at the bottom, but
the burden under which he tottered was fivefold. Above him was the
petty merchant, who in turn carried on his shoulders the lawyer, and
so on until riding along, arrogantly and ostentatiously, at the top
was the figure of the foreign-born Jew, secure through the possession
of his tainted millions.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352"></a>(p. 352)</span> The dangerous straits through which the Waldeck-Rousseau
ministry was obliged to pass were hit off in a cartoon appearing in
the <i>Humoristische Blätter</i> of Berlin, entitled "Between Scylla and
Charybdis." On one side of the narrow waterway a treacherous rock
shows the yawning jaws of the Army. On the other side, equally hideous
and threatening, gleam the sharpened teeth of the face typifying the
Dreyfus Party. Waldeck-Rousseau, appreciating the choppiness of the
sea and the dangerous rocks, calls to his gallant crew: "Forward, dear
friends, look neither to the right nor to the left, and we will win
through at last." Many of the cartoons dealing with the Dreyfus case
were mainly symbolic in their nature; full of figures of "Justice
with her Scales," <span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353"></a>(p. 353)</span> "Justice Blindfolded and with Unsheathed
Sword," "Swords of Damocles" and so on. A Dutch cartoon in
<i>Amsterdammer</i>, entitled "The Last Phase of the Dreyfus Case," showed
Justice taking the unfortunate captain into her car. The horses
drawing the car were led by Scheurer-Kestner and Zola, while following
the chariot, to which they are linked by ignominious chains, were the
discredited Chiefs of the Army. The same paper humorously summed up
the condition of the French General Staff in a picture showing a
falling house of which the occupants, pulling at cross-purposes, were
accelerating the downfall. The decision upon Revision and the
dispatching of the Spax to Cayenne to bring Dreyfus back to France was
commemorated in London <i>Punch</i> in a dignified cartoon called "Toward
Freedom." Madame la République greeted Dreyfus: "Welcome, M. le
Capitaine. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>(p. 354)</span> Let me hope I may soon return you your sword." The
same phase of the case was more maliciously interpreted by <i>Lustige
Blätter</i> of Berlin in a cartoon entitled "At Devil's Island," which

<span class="smaller">THE MEN OF TO-DAY</span></h3>

<p>With the Spanish-American War, the <i>Affaire Dreyfus</i> in France, and
England's long struggle for supremacy in the Transvaal, the period
arbitrarily chosen as the scope of this book comes to a brilliant and
dramatic close. But the cartoonist's work is never done. Nimble
pencils are still busy, as in the days of Rowlandson and Gillray, in
recording and in influencing the trend of history. And although, now
and again during the past century, there has been some individual
cartoonist whose work has stood out more boldly and prominently than
the work of any one of our contemporaries in Europe or in this country
stands out to-day, there has never been a time in the whole history of
comic art when Caricature has held such sway and maintained such
dignity, and has enlisted in her service so many workers of the first
talent and rank. Without alluding to the men of France and England,
what an array it is that contemporary American caricature presents! C.
G. Bush of the New York <i>World</i>, Charles Nelan of the New York
<i>Herald</i>, Frederick Burr Opper and Homer Davenport of the New York
<i>American and Journal</i>, Mahoney of the Washington <i>Star</i>, Bradley of
the Chicago <i>Evening-News</i>, May of the Detroit <i>Journal</i>, "Bart" of
the Minneapolis <i>Journal</i>, Mayfield of the New Orleans
<i>Times-Democrat</i>, Victor Gillam, carrying on the traditions of his
brother&mdash;Rogers, Walker, Hedrick, Bowman, McCutcheon, Lambdin,
Wallace, Leipziger, Berryman, Holme, Bartholemew, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>(p. 357)</span> Carter,
Steele, Powers, Barritt&mdash;and to name these men does not nearly exhaust
the list of those artists whose clever work has amused and
unconsciously influenced hundreds of thousands of thinking American
men and women.</p>

</div>

<p>There are interest and significance in the fact that a majority of the
ablest caricaturists of to-day are devoting their talents almost
exclusively to the daily press. It is an exacting sort of work,
exhaustive both physically and mentally. The mere idea of producing a
single daily cartoon, week in and week out,&mdash;thirty cartoons a month,
three hundred and sixty-five cartoons a year, with the regularity of a
machine,&mdash;is in itself appalling. And yet a steadily growing number of
artists are turning to this class of work, and one reason for this is
that they realize that through the medium of the daily press their
influence is more far-reaching than it possibly can be in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>(p. 358)</span> pages of the comic weeklies, and that at the same time the
exigencies of journalism allow more scope for individuality than do
the carefully planned cartoons of papers like <i>Puck</i> or <i>Judge</i>. Speed
and originality are the two prime requisites of the successful
newspaper cartoon of to-day, a maximum of thought expressed in a
minimum of lines, apposite, clear-cut, and incisive, like a
well-written editorial. Indeed, our leading cartoonists regard their
art as simply another and especially telling medium for giving
expression to editorial opinion. Mr. Bush, "the dean of American
caricaturists," may be said to have spoken for them all when he said,
in a recent interview, that he looks upon a cartoon as an editorial
pure and simple.</p>

<p>"To be a success it should point a moral. Exaggeration and a keen
sense of humor are only adjuncts of the cartoonist, for he must deal
with real people. He must also be a student. I am obliged not only to
use my pencil, but to study hard, and read everything I can lay my
hands on. The features of Roosevelt, Bryan, Hanna, and Croker may be
familiar to me, but I must know what these men are doing. I must also
know what the masses behind these popular characters think and
believe."</p>

Journal."</p>
</div>

<p>Another direct result of the influence of journalism upon caricature,
in addition to that of compelling the artist to keep in closer touch
than ever before with contemporary history, is the growing popularity
of the series method&mdash;a method which dates back to the Macaire of
Philipon and the Mayeux of Traviès, and which consists in portraying
day by day the same more or less grotesque types, ever undergoing some
new and absurd adventure. It is a method which suits the needs of
artist and public alike. To the former, his growing familiarity with
every line and detail of the features <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>(p. 360)</span> and forms of his
pictorial puppets minimizes his daily task, while the public, even
that part of the public which is opposed to comic art in general, or
is out of sympathy with the political attitude of a certain series in
particular, finds itself gradually becoming familiar with the series,
through fugitive and unexpected glimpses, and ends by following the
series with amusement and interest and a growing curiosity as to what
new and absurd complications the artist will next introduce. This
employment of the series idea is as successful in social as political
satire. Mr. Outcault's "Yellow Kid" and "Buster Brown," Mr. Opper's
"Happy Hooligan" and "Alphonse and Gaston," Gene Carr's "Lady
Bountiful," and Carl Schultze's "Foxy Grandpa" are types that have won
friends throughout the breadth of the continent. In the domain of
strictly political caricature, however, there is no series that has
attracted more attention than Homer Davenport's familiar conception of
the Trusts, symbolized as a bulky, overgrown, uncouth figure, a
primordial giant from the Stone Age. And since there have been a
number of apocryphal stories regarding the source of Mr. Davenport's
inspiration, it will not be without interest to print the artist's own
statement. "As a matter of fact," he says, "I got the idea in St.
Mark's Square in Venice. Seeing a flock of pigeons flying about in
that neighborhood I immediately, with my love of birds and beasts,
determined by fair means or foul to purloin a pair. I watched them fly
hither and thither, and in following them came across a statue of
Samson throwing some man or other&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;to the ground.
The abnormal size of the muscles of the figure struck me at once, and
turning round to my wife, who was with me, I said with a sudden
inspired thought, 'The Trusts!'"</p>

<a id="img252" name="img252"></a>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/img252.jpg" width="180" height="457" alt="" title="">
<p class="smcap">Davenport's Conception of the Trusts.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362"></a>(p. 362)</span> Of equal importance are the various series in lighter vein
through which Mr. Opper aims to lead people to the same way of
thinking politically as the paper which he serves. Long years of labor
and constant production do not seem to have in any way drained his
power of invention, for no sooner has one series done its work, and
before the public has become sated with it, than an entirely new line
of cartoons is introduced. Mr. Opper, as well as Mr. Davenport, has
had his fling at and drawn his figure of the Trusts, and to place the
two figures side by side is to contrast the methods and work of the
men. Mr. Opper's purpose seems to be, first of all, to excite your
mirth, and consequently he never fails to produce a certain effect.
When you take up one of his cartoons in which the various stout,
sturdy, and well-fed gentlemen typifying the different Trusts are
engaged in some pleasant game the object of which is the robbing, or
abusing of the pitiable, dwarfish figure representative of the Common
People, your first impulse is a desire to laugh at the ludicrous
contrast. It is only afterwards that you begin to think seriously how
badly the abject little victim is being treated, and what a claim he
has upon your sympathy and indignation. In those series which are
designed entirely along party lines, such as "Willie and his Papa,"
this method is even more effective, since it begins by disarming party
opposition.</p>

<p>Of such men, and the younger draughtsmen of to-day, much more might be
written with sympathetic understanding and enthusiasm. But most of
them belong rather to the century that has just begun rather than that
which has lately closed, and a hundred years from now, whoever
attempts to do for the twentieth century a service analogous to that
which has here been undertaken for the nineteenth, will find an
infinitely ampler and richer store of material, thanks to <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>(p. 363)</span>
this group of younger satirists in the full flood of their enthusiasm,
who are valiantly carrying on the traditions of the men of the
past&mdash;of Leech and Tenniel, of Daumier, and Philipon, and Cham and
André Gill, of Nast and Keppler and Gillam, and who have already begun
to record with trenchant pencil the events that are ushering in the
dawn of the new century.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
